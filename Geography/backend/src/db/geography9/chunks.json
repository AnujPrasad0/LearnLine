      "chunk_text": "FOREWORD\nThe National Curriculum Framework, (NCF) 2005, recommends that children’s\nlife at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle\nmarks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to\nshape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and community.\nThe syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to\nimplement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and\nthe maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope\nthese measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred\nsystem of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and\nteachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and\nto pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given\nspace, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with\nthe information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook\nas the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources\nand sites of learning are ignored. Including creativity and initiative is possible\nif we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers\nof a fixed body of knowledge.\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of\nfunctioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in\nimplementing the annual  calendar so that the required number of teaching\ndays are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and\nevaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making\nchildren’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or\nboredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular\nburden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with\ngreater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching.\nThe textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority\nand space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in\nsmall groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.\nThe National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)\nappreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee\nresponsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory\ngroup in Social Sciences, Professor Hari Vasudevan and the Chief Advisor for\nthis book, Professor M. H. Qureshi for guiding the work of this committee.\nSeveral teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful\nto their principals for making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions\nand organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon their\nresources, material and personnel.  We are especially grateful to the members\nRationalised 2023-24",

India has a land boundary of\nabout 15,200 km and the total length of the\ncoastline of the mainland, including\nAndaman and Nicobar and Lakshadweep,\nis 7,516.6 km.\nIndia is bounded by the young fold\nmountains in the northwest,  north and\nnortheast. South of about 22° north\nlatitude, it begins to taper, and extends\ntowards the Indian Ocean, dividing it into\ntwo seas, the Arabian Sea on the west and\nthe Bay of  Bengal on its east.\nLook at Figure 1.3 and note that the\nlatitudinal and longitudinal extent of the\nmainland is about 30°.

India is a\nsouthward extension of the Asian continent. The\ntrans Indian Ocean routes, which connect the\ncountries of Europe in the West and the\ncountries of  East Asia, provide a strategic central\nlocation to India. Note that the Deccan Peninsula\nprotrudes into the Indian Ocean, thus helping\nIndia to establish close contact with West Asia,\nAfrica and Europe from the western coast and\nwith Southeast and East Asia from the eastern\ncoast. No other country has a long coastline on\nthe Indian Ocean as India has and indeed, it is\nIndia’s eminent position in the Indian Ocean,\nwhich justifies the naming of an Ocean after it.\nFigure 1.2 : Seven Largest Countries of the World\nSource : United Nations Demographic Year Book 2015\nSince the opening of the\nSuez Canal in 1869, India’s distance from Europe\nhas been reduced by 7,000 km.\nRationalised 2023-24",

These mountain\nranges run in a west-east direction from the\nIndus to the Brahmaputra. The Himalayas\nrepresent the loftiest and one of the most\nrugged mountain barriers of the world. They\nform an arc, which covers a distance of about\n2,400 Km. Their width varies from 400 Km in\nKashmir to 150 Km in Arunachal Pradesh. The\naltitudinal variations are greater in the eastern\nhalf than those in the western half. The\nHimalaya consists of three parallel ranges in\nits longitudinal extent. A number of valleys lie\nbetween these ranges. The northern-most\nrange is known as the Great or Inner\nHimalayas or the Himadri. It is the most\ncontinuous range consisting of the loftiest\npeaks\nwith\nan\naverage\nheight\nof\n6,000 metres. It contains all prominent\nHimalayan peaks.\nRationalised 2023-24",

This is\nthe northernmost point of the Ganga delta. The\nriver bifurcates here; the Bhagirathi-Hooghly\n(a distributary) flows southwards through the\ndeltaic plains to the Bay of Bengal. The\nmainstream, flows southwards into\nBangladesh and is joined by the Brahmaputra.\nFurther downstream, it is known as the\nMeghna. This mighty river, with waters from\nthe Ganga and the Brahmaputra, flows into\nthe Bay of Bengal. The delta formed by these\nrivers is known as the Sundarban Delta.\n• The Sundarban Delta derived\nits name from the Sundari tree, which grows well\nin marshland.\n•  It is the world’s largest and fastest growing delta.\nIt is also the home of Royal Bengal tiger.\nThe  length of the Ganga is over 2500 km.\nLook at Figure 3.4; can you identify the type of\ndrainage pattern formed by the Ganga river\nsystem? Ambala is located on the water divide\nbetween the Indus and the Ganga river systems.\nThe plains from Ambala to the Sunderban\nstretch over nearly 1800 km, but the fall in its\nslope is hardly 300 metres. In other words, there\nis a fall of just one metre for every 6 km.\nTherefore, the river develops large meanders.\nThe Brahmaputra River System\nThe Brahmaputra rises in Tibet east of\nMansarowar lake very close to the sources of\nthe Indus and the Satluj. It is slightly longer\nthan the Indus, and most of its course lies\noutside India. It flows eastwards parallel to\nthe Himalayas. On reaching the Namcha\nBarwa (7757 m), it takes a ‘U’ turn and enters\nIndia in Arunachal Pradesh through a gorge.\nHere, it is called the Dihang and it is joined by\nthe Dibang, the Lohit, and many other\ntributaries to form the Brahmaputra in Assam.\n•  Brahmaputra is known as\nthe Tsang Po in Tibet and Jamuna in Bangladesh.\nRationalised 2023-24",

The\nBrahmaputra has a braided channel in its entire\nlength in Assam and forms many riverine islands.\nDo you remember the name of the world’s largest\nriverine island formed by the Brahmaputra?\nEvery year during the rainy season, the\nriver overflows its banks, causing widespread\ndevastation due to floods in Assam and\nBangladesh. Unlike other north Indian rivers,\nthe Brahmaputra is marked by huge deposits\nof silt on its bed causing  the riverbed to rise.\nThe river also shifts its channel frequently.\nThe Peninsular Rivers\nThe main water divide in Peninsular India is\nformed by the Western Ghats, which runs from\nnorth to south close to the western coast.  Most\nof the major rivers of the Peninsula, such as\nthe Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and\nthe Kaveri flow eastwards and drain into the\nBay of Bengal. These rivers make deltas at\ntheir mouths. There are numerous small\nstreams flowing west of the Western Ghats.\nThe Narmada and the Tapi are the only long\nrivers, which flow west and make esturies.  The\ndrainage basins of the peninsular rivers are\ncomparatively smaller in size.\nThe Narmada Basin\nThe Narmada rises in the Amarkantak hills\nin Madhya Pradesh. It flows towards the west\nin a rift valley formed due to faulting. On its\nway to the sea, the Narmada creates many\npicturesque locations. The ‘Marble rocks’,\nnear Jabalpur, where the Narmada flows\nthrough a deep gorge, and the ‘Dhuadhar\nfalls, where the river plunges over steep rocks,\nare some of the notable ones.\n• The Narmada river\nconservation mission has been undertaken by the\ngovernment of Madhya Pradesh by a scheme named\nNamami Devi Narmade.

Similarly, you may have visited\nsome other tourist spot near a lake and enjoyed\nboating, swimming and other water games.\nImagine that if Srinagar, Nainital and other\ntourists places did not have a lake would they\nhave been as attractive as they are today? Have\nyou ever tried to know the importance of lakes\nin  making a place attractive to tourists?  Apart\nfrom attraction for tourists, lakes are also useful\nto human beings in many ways.\n• Lakes of large extent are called seas,\nlike the Caspian, the Dead and the Aral seas.\nIndia has many lakes. These differ from\neach other in size and other characteristics.\nMost lakes are permanent; some contain water\nonly during the rainy season, like the lakes in\nthe basins of inland drainage of semi-arid\nregions. There are some lakes which are the\nresult of the action of glaciers and ice sheets,\nwhile others have been formed by wind, river\naction and human activities.\nA meandering river across a floodplain\nforms cut-offs that later develops into  ox-bow\nlakes. Spits and bars form lagoons in the\ncoastal areas, e.g. the Chilika lake, the Pulicat\nlake and the Kolleru lake. Lakes in the region\nof inland drainage are sometimes seasonal; for\nexample, the Sambhar lake in Rajasthan, which\nis a salt water lake. Its water is used for\nproducing salt.\nMost of the freshwater lakes are in the\nHimalayan region.  They are of glacial origin.\nIn other words, they  formed when glaciers\ndug out a basin, which was later filled with\nsnowmelt. The Wular lake in Jammu and\nKashmir, in contrast, is the result of tectonic\nactivity.  It is the largest freshwater lake in\nIndia.  The Dal lake, Bhimtal, Nainital, Loktak\nand Barapani are some other important\nfreshwater lakes.\nFigure 3.6 : Loktak Lake\nRationalised 2023-24",

On the\nother hand, a heavy load of untreated sewage\nand industrial effluents are emptied into the\nrivers. This affects not only the quality of water\nbut also the self-cleansing capacity of the river.\nFor example, given the adequate streamflow,\nthe Ganga water is able to dilute and assimilate\npollution loads within 20 km of large cities.\nBut the increasing urbanisation and\nindustrialisation do not allow it to happen and\nthe pollution level of many rivers has been\nrising.

These are the two of the three\nbasic elements that one learns about the natural\nenvironment of any area.  In this chapter you\nwill learn about the third, that is, the\natmospheric conditions that prevail over our\ncountry.  Why do we wear woollens in December\nor why it is hot and uncomfortable in the month\nof May, and why it rains in June - July?  The\nanswers to all these questions can be found out\nby studying about the climate of India.\nClimate refers to the sum total of  weather\nconditions and variations over a large  area for\na long period of time (more than thirty years).\nWeather refers to the state of the atmosphere\nover an area at any point of time. The elements\nof weather and climate are the same, i.e.\ntemperature, atmospheric pressure, wind,\nhumidity and precipitation. You may have\nobserved that the weather conditions fluctuate\nvery often even within a day. But there is some\ncommon pattern over a few weeks or months,\ni.e. days are cool or hot, windy or calm, cloudy\nor bright, and wet or dry. On the basis of the\ngeneralised monthly atmospheric conditions,\nthe year is divided into seasons such as winter,\nsummer or rainy seasons.\nThe world is divided into a number of\nclimatic regions. Do you know what type of\nclimate India has and why it is so? We will\nlearn about it in this chapter.\n•  The word monsoon is\nderived from the Arabic word ‘mausim’ which\nliterally means season.\n• ‘Monsoon’ refers to the seasonal reversal in the\nwind direction during a year.\nCLIMATE\nThe climate of India is described as the\n‘monsoon’ type. In Asia, this type of climate\nis found mainly in the south and the southeast.\nDespite an overall unity in the general pattern,\nthere are perceptible regional variations in\nclimatic conditions within the country. Let us\ntake two important elements – temperature and\nprecipitation, and examine how they vary from\nplace to place and season to season.\nIn summer, the mercury occasionally\ntouches 50°C in some parts of the Rajasthan\ndesert, whereas it may be around 20°C in\nPahalgam in Jammu and Kashmir. On a winter\nnight, temperature at Drass in Jammu and\nKashmir may be as low as minus 45°C.\nThiruvananthapuram, on the other hand, may\nhave a temperature of 22°C.\nIn certain places there is a\nwide difference between day and night\ntemperatures. In the Thar Desert the day\ntemperature may rise to 50°C, and drop down\nto near 15°C the same night. On the other hand,\nthere is hardly any difference in day and night\ntemperatures in the Andaman and Nicobar\nislands or in Kerala.\nLet us now look at precipitation. There are\nvariations not only in the form and types of\nprecipitation but also in its amount and the\nseasonal distribution. While precipitation is\nmostly in the form of snowfall in the upper parts\nof Himalayas, it rains over the rest of the\ncountry. The annual precipitation varies from\nover 400 cm in Meghalaya to less than 10 cm\nin Ladakh and western Rajasthan. Most parts\nof the country receive rainfall from June to\nSeptember.

High mountains\nact as barriers for cold or hot winds; they may\nalso cause precipitation if they are high enough\nand lie in the path of rain-bearing winds. The\nleeward side of mountains remains relatively dry.\nFACTORS AFFECTING INDIA’S CLIMATE\nLatitude\nThe Tropic of Cancer passes through the middle\nof the country from the Rann of Kuchchh in the\nwest to Mizoram in the east. Almost half of the\ncountry, lying south of the Tropic of Cancer,\nbelongs to the tropical area. All the remaining\narea, north of the Tropic, lies in the sub-tropics.\nTherefore, India’s climate has characteristics of\ntropical as well as subtropical climates.\nAltitude\nIndia has mountains to the north, which have\nan average height of about 6,000 metres. India\nalso has a vast coastal area where the\nmaximum elevation is about 30 metres. The\nHimalayas prevent the cold winds from Central\nAsia from entering the subcontinent. It is\nbecause of these mountains that this\nsubcontinent experiences comparatively\nmilder winters as compared to central Asia.\nPressure and Winds\nThe climate and associated weather conditions\nin India are governed by the following\natmospheric conditions:\n•\nPr\nPr\nPr\nPr\nPressur\nessur\nessur\nessur\nessure and sur\ne and sur\ne and sur\ne and sur\ne and surface winds;\nface winds;\nface winds;\nface winds;\nface winds;\n•\nUpper air circulation; and\nUpper air circulation; and\nUpper air circulation; and\nUpper air circulation; and\nUpper air circulation; and\n•\nWester\nester\nester\nester\nester n cyclonic disturbances and\nn cyclonic disturbances and\nn cyclonic disturbances and\nn cyclonic disturbances and\nn cyclonic disturbances and\ntropical cyclones\ntropical cyclones\ntropical cyclones\ntropical cyclones\ntropical cyclones.\nIndia lies in the region of north easterly\nwinds. These winds originate from the\nsubtropical high-pressure belt of the northern\ncoast gets a large portion of its rain during\nOctober and November.\nIn general, coastal areas experience less\ncontrasts in temperature conditions. Seasonal\ncontrasts are more in the interior of the\ncountry. There is decrease in rainfall generally\nfrom east to west in the Northern Plains. These\nvariations have given rise to variety in lives of\npeople – in terms of the food they eat, the\nclothes they wear and also the kind of houses\nthey live in.\n•\nWhy the houses in Rajasthan have thick\nwalls and flat roofs?\n•  Why is it that the houses in the Tarai region and\nin Goa and Mangalore have sloping roofs?\n• Why houses in Assam are built on stilts?\nCLIMATIC CONTROLS\nThere are six major controls of  the climate of\nany place. They are: latitude, altitude,\npressure and wind system, distance from\nthe sea (continentality), ocean currents and\nrelief features.\nDue to the curvature of the earth, the\namount of solar energy received varies\naccording to latitude. As a result, air\ntemperature generally decreases from the\nequator towards the poles. As one goes from\nthe surface of the earth to higher altitudes,\nthe atmosphere becomes less dense and\ntemperature decreases. The hills are therefore\ncooler during summers. The pressure and\nwind system of any area depend on the\nlatitude and altitude of the place. Thus it\ninfluences the temperature and rainfall\npattern. The sea exerts a moderating influence\non climate: As the distance from the sea\nincreases, its moderating influence decreases\nand the people experience extreme weather\nconditions. This condition is known as\ncontinentality (i.e. very hot during summers\nand very cold during winters). Ocean currents\nalong with onshore winds affect the climate of\nthe coastal areas, For example, any coastal\narea with warm or cold currents flowing past\nit, will be warmed or cooled if the winds are\nonshore.\nRationalised 2023-24",

Generally, these winds carry little\nmoisture as they originate and blow over land.\nTherefore, they bring little or no rain. Hence,\nIndia should have been an arid land, but it is\nnot so. Let us see why?\nCoriolis force: An apparent force caused by the\nearth’s rotation. The Coriolis force is responsible for\ndeflecting winds towards the right in the northern\nhemisphere and towards the left in the southern\nhemisphere.  This is also known as ‘Ferrel’s Law’.\nThe pressure and wind conditions over\nIndia are unique. During winter, there is a\nhigh-pressure area north of the Himalayas.\nCold dry winds blow from this region to the\nlow-pressure areas over the oceans to the\nsouth. In summer, a low-pressure area\ndevelops over interior Asia, as well as, over\nnorthwestern India. This causes a complete\nreversal of the direction of winds during\nsummer. Air moves from the high-pressure\narea over the southern Indian Ocean, in a\nsouth-easterly direction, crosses the equator,\nand turns right towards the low-pressure areas\nover the Indian subcontinent. These are known\nas the Southwest Monsoon winds. These winds\nblow over the warm oceans, gather moisture\nand bring widespread rainfall over the\nmainland of India.\nTHE SEASONS\nThe monsoon type of climate is characterised\nby a distinct seasonal pattern. The weather\nconditions greatly  change from one season to\nthe other. These changes are particularly\nnoticeable in the interior parts of the country.\nThe coastal areas do not experience much\nvariation in temperature though there is\nvariation in rainfall pattern. How many seasons\nare experienced in your place? Four main\nseasons can be identified in India – the cold\nweather season, the hot weather season, the\nadvancing monsoon and the retreating\nmonsoon with some regional variations.\nThe Cold Weather Season (Winter)\nThe cold weather season begins from mid-\nNovember in northern India and stays till\nFebruary. December and January are the\ncoldest months in the northern part of India.\nThe temperature decreases from south to the\nnorth. The average temperature of Chennai, on\nthe eastern coast, is between 24°– 25° Celsius,\nwhile in the northern plains, it ranges between\n10°C and 15° Celsius. Days are warm and\nnights are cold. Frost is common in the north\nand the higher slopes of the Himalayas\nexperience snowfall.\nDuring this season, the northeast trade\nwinds prevail over the country. They blow from\nland to sea and hence, for most part of the\ncountry, it is a dry season. Some amount of\nrainfall occurs on the Tamil Nadu coast from\nthese winds as, here they blow from sea to land.\nIn the northern part of the country, a feeble\nhigh-pressure region develops, with light winds\nmoving outwards from this area. Influenced by\nthe relief, these winds blow through the Ganga\nvalley from the west and the northwest. The\nweather is normally marked by clear sky, low\ntemperatures and low humidity and feeble,\nvariable winds.\nA characteristic feature of the cold weather\nseason over the northern plains is the inflow of\ncyclonic disturbances from the west and the\nnorthwest. These low-pressure systems,\noriginate over the Mediterranean Sea and\nwestern Asia and move into India, along with\nthe westerly flow. They cause the much-needed\nwinter rains over the plains and snowfall in the\nmountains. Although the total amount of\nwinter rainfall locally known as ‘mahawat’ is\nsmall, they are of immense importance for the\ncultivation of ‘rabi’ crops.\nThe peninsular region does not have a well-\ndefined cold season.

      "chunk_text": "CONTEMPORARY INDIA-I\nThe Hot Weather Season (Summer)\nDue to the apparent northward movement of\nthe sun, the global heat belt shifts northwards.\nAs such, from March to May, it is hot weather\nseason in India. The influence of the shifting of\nthe heat belt can be seen clearly from\ntemperature recordings taken during March-\nMay at different latitudes. In March, the highest\ntemperature is about 38° Celsius, recorded on\nthe Deccan plateau. In April, temperatures in\nGujarat and Madhya Pradesh are around 42°\nCelsius. In May, temperature of 45° Celsius is\ncommon in the northwestern parts of the\ncountry. In peninsular India, temperatures\nremain lower due to the moderating influence\nof the oceans.\nThe summer months experience rising\ntemperature and falling air pressure in the\nnorthern part of the country. Towards the end\nof May, an elongated low-pressure area\ndevelops in the region extending from the Thar\nDesert in the northwest to Patna and\nChotanagpur plateau in the east and\nsoutheast. Circulation of air begins to set in\naround this trough.\nA striking feature of the hot weather season\nis the ‘loo’. These are strong, gusty, hot, dry\nwinds blowing during the day over the north\nand northwestern India. Sometimes they even\ncontinue until late in the evening. Direct\nexposure to these winds may even prove to be\nfatal. Dust storms are very common during the\nmonth of May in northern India. These storms\nbring temporary relief as they lower the\ntemperature and may bring light rain and cool\nbreeze. This is also the season for localised\nthunderstorms, associated with violent winds,\ntorrential downpours, often accompanied by\nhail. In West Bengal, these storms are known\nas the ‘Kaal Baisakhi’.\nTowards the close of the summer season,\npre-monsoon showers are common especially,\nin Kerala and Karnataka. They help in the early\nripening of mangoes, and are often referred to\nas ‘mango showers’.\nAdvancing Monsoon (The Rainy Season)\nBy early June, the low-pressure condition over\nthe northern plains intensifies. It attracts, the\ntrade winds of the southern hemisphere. These\nsouth-east trade winds originate over the\nwarm subtropical areas of the southern oceans.\nThey cross the equator and blow in a south-\nwesterly direction entering the Indian peninsula\nas the south-west monsoon. As these winds\nblow over warm oceans, they bring abundant\nmoisture to the subcontinent. These winds are\nstrong and blow at an average velocity of 30\nkm per hour. With the exception of the extreme\nnorth-west, the monsoon winds cover the\ncountry in about a month.\nThe inflow of the south-west monsoon into\nIndia brings about a total change in the\nweather. Early in the season, the windward\nside of the Western Ghats receives very heavy\nrainfall, more than 250 cm. The Deccan\nPlateau and parts of Madhya Pradesh also\nreceive some amount of rain in spite of lying\nin the rain shadow area. The maximum rainfall\nof this season is received in the north-eastern\npart of the country. Mawsynram in the\nsouthern ranges of the Khasi Hills receives the\nhighest average rainfall in the world. Rainfall\nin the Ganga valley decreases from the east to\nthe west. Rajasthan and parts of Gujarat get\nscanty rainfall.\nAnother phenomenon associated with the\nmonsoon is its tendency to have ‘breaks’ in\nrainfall. Thus, it has wet and dry spells. In\nother words, the monsoon rains take place\nonly for a few days at a time. They are\ninterspersed with rainless intervals. These\nbreaks in monsoon are related to the\nmovement of the monsoon trough. For\nvarious reasons, the trough and its axis keep\non moving northward or southward, which\ndetermines the spatial distribution of rainfall.\nWhen the axis of the monsoon trough lies over\nthe plains, rainfall is good in these parts. On\nthe other hand, whenever the axis shifts closer\nto the Himalayas, there are longer dry spells\nin the plains, and widespread rain occur in\nthe mountainous catchment areas of the\nHimalayan rivers. These heavy rains bring in\nRationalised 2023-24",

The\nfrequency and intensity of tropical\ndepressions too, determine the amount and\nduration of monsoon rains. These\ndepressions form at the head of the Bay of\nBengal and cross over to the mainland. The\ndepressions follow the axis of the “monsoon\ntrough of low pressure”. The monsoon is\nknown for its uncertainties. The alternation\nof dry and wet spells vary in intensity,\nfrequency and duration. While it causes heavy\nfloods in one part, it may be responsible for\ndroughts in the other.  It is often irregular in\nits arrival and its retreat. Hence, it sometimes\ndisturbs the farming schedule of millions of\nfarmers all over the country.\nRetreating/Post Monsoons\n(The Transition Season)\nDuring October-November, with the apparent\nmovement of the sun towards the south, the\nmonsoon trough or the low-pressure trough\nover the northern plains becomes weaker. This\nis gradually replaced by a high-pressure\nsystem.  The south-west monsoon winds\nweaken and start withdrawing gradually. By\nthe beginning of October, the monsoon\nwithdraws from the Northern Plains.\nThe months of October-November form a\nperiod of transition from hot rainy season to\ndry winter conditions. The retreat of the\nmonsoon is marked by clear skies and rise in\nMawsynram, the wettest\nplace on the earth is also reputed for its\nstalagmite and stalactite caves.\nThe low-pressure conditions, over north-\nwestern India, get transferred to the Bay of\nBengal by early November. This shift is\nassociated with the occurrence of cyclonic\ndepressions, which originate over the\nAndaman Sea. These cyclones generally cross\nthe eastern coasts of India cause heavy and\nwidespread rain. These tropical cyclones are\noften very destructive. The thickly populated\ndeltas of the Godavari, the Krishna and the\nKaveri are frequently struck by cyclones, which\ncause great damage to life and property.\nSometimes, these cyclones  arrive at the coasts\nof Odisha, West Bengal and Bangladesh. The\nbulk of the rainfall of the Coromandel Coast is\nderived from depressions and cyclones.\nDISTRIBUTION OF RAINFALL\nParts of western coast and northeastern India\nreceive over about 400 cm of rainfall annually.\nHowever, it is less than 60 cm in western\nRajasthan and adjoining parts of Gujarat,\nHaryana and Punjab. Rainfall is equally low\nin the interior of the Deccan plateau, and east\nof the Sahyadris. Why do these regions receive\nlow rainfall? A third area of low precipitation\nis around Leh in Jammu and Kashmir. The rest\nof the country receives moderate rainfall.\nSnowfall is restricted to the Himalayan region.\nOwing to the nature of monsoons, the\nannual rainfall is highly variable from year to\nyear. Variability is high in the regions of low\nrainfall, such as parts of Rajasthan, Gujarat\nand the leeward side of the Western Ghats. As\nsuch, while areas of high rainfall are liable to\nbe affected by floods, areas of low rainfall are\ndrought-prone (Figure 4.3).\nMONSOON AS A UNIFYING BOND\nYou have already known the way the Himalayas\nprotect the subcontinent from extremely cold\nwinds from central Asia. This enables northern\nIndia to have uniformly higher temperatures\ncompared to other areas on the same latitudes.\nSimilarly, the Peninsular plateau, under the\ninfluence of the sea from three sides, has\nmoderate temperatures. Despite such\ntemperature. While day temperatures are\nhigh, nights are cool and pleasant. The land\nis still moist. Owing to the conditions of high\ntemperature and humidity, the weather\nbecomes rather oppressive during the day.\nThis is commonly known as ‘October heat’. In\nthe second half of October, the mercury begins\nto fall rapidly in northern India.\nRationalised 2023-24",

This type of vegetation is found in the\nnorth-western part of the country, including\nsemi-arid areas of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya\nPradesh, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and\nHaryana. Acacias, palms, euphorbias and cacti\nare the main plant species. Trees are scattered\nand have long roots penetrating deep into the\nsoil in order to get moisture. The stems are\nsucculent to conserve water. Leaves are mostly\nthick and small to minimise evaporation. These\nforests give way to thorn forests and scrubs in\narid areas.\nIn these forests, the common animals are\nrats, mice, rabbits, fox, wolf, tiger, lion, wild ass,\nhorses and camels.\nMontane Forests\nIn mountainous areas, the decrease in\ntemperature with increasing altitude leads to\nthe corresponding change in natural\nvegetation. As such, there is a succession of\nnatural vegetation belts in the same order as\nwe see from the tropical to the tundra region.\nThe  wet temperate type of forests are found\nbetween a height of 1000 and 2000 metres.\nEvergreen broad-leaf trees, such as oaks and\nchestnuts predominate. Between 1500 and\n3000 metres, temperate forests containing\nconiferous trees, like pine, deodar, silver fir,\nspruce and cedar, are found. These forests\ncover mostly the southern slopes of the\nHimalayas, places having high altitude in\nsouthern and north-east India. At higher\nelevations, temperate grasslands are common.\nAt high altitudes, generally, more than 3,600\nmetres above the sea level, temperate forests\nand grasslands give way to the Alpine\nvegetation. Silver fir, junipers, pines and\nbirches are the common trees of these forests.\nHowever, they get progressively stunted as\nthey approach the snow-line. Ultimately,\nthrough shrubs and scrubs, they merge into\nthe Alpine grasslands. These are used\nextensively for grazing by nomadic tribes, like\nthe Gujjars and the Bakarwals. At higher\naltitudes, mosses and lichens form part of\ntundra vegetation.\nThe common animals found in these forests\nare Kashmir stag, spotted dear, wild sheep, jack\nrabbit, Tibetan antelope, yak, snow leopard,\nsquirrels, Shaggy horn wild ibex, bear and rare\nred panda, sheep and goats with thick hair.\nMangrove Forests\nThe mangrove tidal forests are found in the\nareas of coasts influenced by tides.

Coal is but a piece of rock, until people\nwere able to invent technology to obtain it and\nmake it ‘resource’. Natural events, like a flood\nor a Tsunami, becomes a ‘disaster’ only when\nthey affect a crowded village or a town.\nHence, population is the pivotal element in\nsocial studies. It is the point of reference from\nwhich all other elements are observed and from\nwhich they derive significance and meaning.\n‘Resources’, ‘calamities’ and ‘disasters’ are all\nmeaningful only in relation to human beings.\nTheir numbers, distribution, growth and\ncharacteristics or qualities provide the basic\nbackground for understanding and\nappreciating all aspects of the environment.\nHuman beings are producers and\nconsumers of earth’s resources.

Uttar\nPradesh accounts for about 16 per cent of the\ncountry’s population.  On the other hand, the\nHimalayan state of Sikkim has a population of\njust about 0.6 million and Lakshadweep has\nonly 64,429 people.\nAlmost half of India’s population lives in\njust five states. These are Uttar Pradesh,\nMaharashtra, Bihar, West Bengal and Andhra\nPradesh. Rajasthan, the biggest state in terms\nof area, has only 5.5 per cent of the total\npopulation of India (Figure 6.2)\n• What could be the reason\nof uneven distribution of population in India?\nCensus\nA census is an official enumeration of population done periodically. In India, the first census was held in the year\n1872. The first complete census, however, was taken in the year 1881.

Such a change can be expressed\nin two ways: in terms of absolute numbers and\nin terms of percentage change per year.\nThe absolute numbers added each year or\ndecade is the magnitude of increase.

The main cause\nof the rate of growth of the Indian population\nhas been the rapid decline in death rates.\nTill 1980, high birth rates and declining\ndeath rates led to a large difference between\nbirth rates and death rates resulting in higher\nrates of population growth. Since 1981, birth\nrates have also started declining gradually,\nresulting in a gradual decline in the rate of\npopulation growth. What are the reasons for\nthis trend?\nThe third component of population growth\nis migration. Migration is the movement of\npeople across regions and territories. Migration\ncan be internal (within the country) or\ninternational (between the countries).\nInternal migration does not change the size\nof the population, but influences the\ndistribution of population within the nation.\nMigration plays a very significant role in\nchanging the composition and distribution of\npopulation.\npopulation in 1951 to 31.80 per cent in 2011.\nThere has been a significant increase in the\nnumber of ‘million plus cities’ from 35 to 53 in\njust one decade, i.e., 2001 to 2011.\nAdolescent Population\nThe most significant feature of the Indian\npopulation is the size of its adolescent\npopulation.  It constitutes one-fifth of the total\npopulation of India.  Adolescents are,\ngenerally, grouped in the age group of 10 to\n19 years.  They are the most important\nresource for the future. Nutrition\nrequirements of adolescents are higher than\nthose of a normal child or adult.  Poor nutrition\ncan lead to deficiency and stunted growth.\nBut in India,  the diet available to adolescents\nis inadequate in all nutrients. A large number\nof adolescent girls suffer from anaemia. Their\nproblems have so far not received adequate\nattention in the process of development.  The\nadolescent girls have to be sensitised to the\nproblems they confront. Awareness among\nthem can be improved through the spread of\nliteracy and education.\nNational Population Policy\nRecognising that the planning of families\nwould improve individual health and\nwelfare, the Government of India initiated a\ncomprehensive Family Planning Programme\nin 1952. The Family Welfare Programme has\nsought to promote responsible and planned\nparenthood on a voluntary basis. The National\nPopulation Policy (NPP) 2000 is a\nculmination of years of planned efforts.\nThe NPP 2000 provides a policy\nframework for imparting free and compulsory\nschool education up to 14 years of age,\nreducing infant mortality rate to below 30 per\n1000 live births, achieving universal\nimmunisation of children against all vaccine\npreventable diseases, promoting delayed\nmarriage for girls, and making family welfare\na people-centred programme.\nActivity\nActivity\nActivity\nActivity\nActivity\nOn a map, trace the migration of each\nof your grandparents and parents\nsince their birth. Try and analyse the\nreasons for each move.\nIn India, most migrations have been from\nrural to urban areas because of the “push”\nfactor in rural areas. These are adverse\nconditions of poverty and unemployment in the\nrural areas and the “pull” of the city in terms\nof increased employment opportunities and\nbetter living conditions.\nMigration is an important determinant of\npopulation change. It changes not only the\npopulation size but also the population\ncomposition of urban and rural populations\nin terms of age and sex composition. In India,\nthe rural-urban migration has resulted in a\nsteady increase in the percentage of population\nin cities and towns. The urban population has\nincreased from 17.29 per cent of the total\nRationalised 2023-24",
