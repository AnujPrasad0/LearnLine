    "question": "How is pipeline transport network important in the transport system of India? Explain with an example.",
    "marks": "5",
    "answer": "(i) The pipeline transport network is a new arrival on the transportation map of India. [1] (ii) In the past, these were used to transport water to cities and industries. [1] (iii) Now, these are used for transporting crude oil, petroleum products and natural gas from oil and natural gas fields to refineries, fertilizer factories and big thermal power plants. [1] (iv) Solids can also be transported through a pipeline when converted into slurry. [1] (v) Farther inland locations of refineries like Barauni, Mathura, Panipat and gas based fertilizer plants could be thought of only because of pipelines. [1]"

    "question": "How have physical and economic factors influenced the distribution pattern of the Indian Railway Network? Explain with examples.",
    "marks": "5",
    "answer": "The distribution pattern of the railway network in the country has been largely influenced by the physiographic and economic factors: [0] (i) The northern plains with their vast level land, high population density and rich agricultural resources provided the most favourable condition for their growth. However, a large number of rivers requiring construction of bridges across their wide beds posed some obstacles. [1] (ii) In the hilly terrains of the peninsular region, railway tracts are laid through low hills, gaps or tunnels. The Himalayan mountainous regions too are unfavourable for the construction of railway lines due to high relief, sparse population and lack of economic opportunities. [1] (iii) Likewise, it was difficult to lay railway lines on the sandy plain of western Rajasthan, swamps of Gujarat, forested tracks of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Jharkhand. [1] (iv) The contiguous stretch of Sahyadri could be crossed only through gaps or passes (Ghats). [1] (v) In recent times, the development of the Konkan railway along the west coast has facilitated the movement of passengers and goods in this most important economic region of India. It has also faced a number of problems such as the sinking of track in some stretches and landslides. [1]"

    "marks": "5",
    "answer": "(i) Rapid improvement in technology has been one major factor that has stimulated the globalisation process. [1] (ii) For instance, the past fifty years have seen several improvements in the transportation technology. [1] (iii) Goods are placed in containers that can be loaded intact onto ships, railways, planes and trucks. [1] (iv) This has made much faster delivery of goods across long distances possible at lower costs. [1] (v) Even more remarkable have been the developments in information and communication technology. [1]"
