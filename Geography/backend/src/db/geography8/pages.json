        "The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that",

        "continues to shape our  system and causes a gap between the school,",
        "home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of",
        "NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to",
        "discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between",
