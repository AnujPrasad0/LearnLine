      "chunk_text": "The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that\nchildren’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This\nprinciple marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which\ncontinues to shape our  system and causes a gap between the school,\nhome and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of\nNCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to\ndiscourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between\ndifferent subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly\nfurther in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in\nthe National Policy on Education (1986).\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals\nand teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning\nand to  pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise\nthat, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by\nengaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the\nprescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons\nwhy other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity\nand initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in\nlearning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of\nfunctioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in\nimplementing the annual  calendar so that the required number of teaching\ndays are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and\nevaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making\nchildren’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or\nboredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular\nburden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with\ngreater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching.\nThe textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority\nand  space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in\nsmall groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.\nThe National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)\nappreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee\nresponsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory\ncommittee for textbooks in Social Sciences, at the upper primary level,\nProfessor Hari Vasudevan and the Chief Advisor for this book, Vibha\nParthasarathi, for guiding the work of this committee.

      "chunk_text": "Resources and Development\nTime and technology are two important factors that\ncan change substances into resources. Both are related\nto the needs of the people. People themselves are the\nmost important resource. It is their ideas, knowledge,\ninventions and discoveries that lead to the creation of\nmore resources. Each discovery or invention leads to many\nothers. The discovery of fire led to the practice of cooking\nand other processes while the invention of the wheel\nultimately resulted in development of\nnewer modes of transport. The technology\nto create hydroelectricity\nhas turned energy in fast\nflowing\nwater\ninto\nan\nimportant resource.\nTypes of Resources\nResources are generally classified into\nnatural, human made and human.\nNatural Resources\nResources that are drawn from Nature and used without\nmuch modification are called natural resources. The\nair we breathe, the water in our rivers and lakes, the\nsoils, minerals are all natural resources. Many of these\nresources are free gifts of nature and can be used directly.\nIn some cases tools and technology may be needed to\nuse a natural resource in the best possible way.\nNatural resources can be broadly categorised into\nrenewable and non-renewable resources.\nRenewable resources are those which get renewed\nor replenished quickly. Some of these are unlimited\nand are not affected by human activities, such as solar\nand wind energy. Yet careless use of certain renewable\nresources like water, soil and forest can affect their\nstock. Water seems to be an unlimited renewable\nresource. But shortage and drying up of natural\nwater sources is a major problem in many parts of the\nworld today.\nNon-renewable resources are those which have a\nlimited stock. Once the stocks are exhausted it may\ntake thousands of years to be renewed or replenished.\nSince this period is much more than human life spans,\n“So I am a\nresource too!”\n“A very\nvaluable one!”\nAmma’s List\nCotton cloth\nIron ore\nIntelligence\nMedicinal plants\nMedical knowledge\nCoal deposits\nAgricultural land\nClean environment\nOld folk songs\nGood weather\nResourcefulness\nA good singing voice\nGrandmother’s\nhome remedies\nAffection from\nfriends and family\nBeautiful scenery\nActivity\nCircle those\nresources from\nAmma’s list that\nare regarded\nas having no\ncommercial value.\nGlossary\nTechnology: It is\nthe application of\nlatest knowledge\nand skill in doing\nor making things.\n2021–22",

Coal,\npetroleum and natural gas are some examples.\nThe distribution of natural resources depends\nupon number of physical factors like terrain, climate\nand altitude. The distribution of resources is unequal\nbecause these factors differ so much over the earth.\nHuman Made Resources\nSometimes, natural substances become resources only\nwhen their original form has been changed. Iron ore\nwas not a resource until people learnt to extract iron\nfrom it. People use natural resources to make buildings,\nbridges, roads, machinery and vehicles, which are\nknown as human made resources. Technology is also\na human made resource.\n“So people like us use natural resources to make human\nmade resources,” said Mona nodding in understanding.\n“Yes,” said Raju.\nHuman Resources\nPeople can make the best use of nature to create more\nresources when they have the knowledge, skill and the\nGlossary\nStock of Resource\nIt is the amount of\nresources available\nfor use.\nLet’s do\nThink of a few\nrenewable resources\nand mention how\ntheir stock may get\naffected by overuse.\n“…its all thanks\nto the knowledge,\neducation and\nskill… we could find\na solution…\nthat’s it!\n“Crops ruined\ndue to\ndrought”.\n“Can I find\na solution?”.\nRead and Ponder: Humans are interdependent on\neach other.

She dreamt that all\nthe water on the earth had dried up and all the\ntrees cut down. There was no shade and nothing to\neat or drink. People were suffering and roaming around\ndesperately looking for food and shade.\nShe told her mother about the dream. “Amma can this\nreally happen?” she asked.\n“Yes,” Amma replied. “If we are not careful then even\nrenewable resources can become very scarce and the\nnon-renewable ones can definitely get exhausted”. “What\ncan we do about it,” Raju asked. “Lots,” replied Amma.\nUsing resources carefully and giving them time to get\nrenewed is called resource conservation.

This is commonly termed as Land use.\nCan you list out the different ways in which Mamba’s\nand Peter’s family use their land?\nThe use of land is determined by physical factors\nsuch as topography, soil, climate, minerals and\navailability of water. Human factors such as population\nand technology are also important determinants of land\nuse pattern.\nLand can also be classified on the basis of ownership\nas – private land and community land. Private land\nis owned by individuals whereas, community land\nis owned by the community for common uses like\ncollection of fodder, fruits, nuts or medicinal herbs.\nThese community lands are also called common\nproperty resources.\nPeople and their demands are ever growing but the\navailability of land is limited. The quality of land also\ndiffers from place to place. People started encroaching\nthe common lands to build up commercial areas,\nhousing complexes in the urban areas and to expand\nthe agricultural land in the rural areas. Today the\nvast changes in the land use pattern also reflect the\ncultural changes in our society. Land degradation,\nlandslides, soil erosion, desertification are the major\nthreats to the environment because of the expansion\nof agriculture and construction activities.\nFig. 2.1: Salzburg in Austria\nNotice in how many ways  the land has been used in the\nabove picture.\nLet’s do\nTalk to some\nelderly person\nin your family or\nneighbourhood and\ncollect information\nabout changes\nin the land use\nover the years, in\nthe place where\nyou live.

The formation of river blocks can\ncause havoc to the settlements downstream on its\nbursting. In the hilly terrain landslides have been a\nmajor and widely spread natural disaster that often\nstrike life and property and occupy a position of major\nconcern.\nA Case Study\nA massive landslide hit Pangi village near Reckong Peo in Kinnaur district of\nHimachal Pradesh and damaged a 200-meter stretch of old Hindustan-Tibet\nroad, National Highway - 22. This landslide was triggered by intense blasting\nat Pangi village. Due to the blasting this weak zone of slope collapsed and\ncaused intense damage to the road and nearby villages. The Pangi village was\ncompletely vacated to avoid any possible loss of life.\nMitigation Mechanism\nAdvancement in scientific techniques has empowered us to understand what\nfactors cause landslides and how to manage them. Some broad mitigation\ntechniques of landslide are as follows:\n• Hazard mapping to locate areas prone to\nlandslides. Hence, such areas can be avoided\nfor building settlements.\n• Construction of retention wall to stop land from\nslipping.\n• Increase in the vegetation cover to arrest\nlandslide.\n• The surface drainage control works to control\nthe movement of landslide along with rain water\nand spring flows.\nA Landslide\nRetention Wall\n2021–22",

Rocks\nfrom which\nminerals are mined\nare known as ores.\nAlthough more\nthan 2,800 types\nof minerals have\nbeen identified,\nonly about 100\nare considered ore\nminerals.\nTypes of Minerals\nThere are over three thousand different minerals.\nOn the basis of composition, minerals are classified\nmainly as metallic and non-metallic minerals (Fig. 3.2).\nMinerals\nMetallic\nFerrous\nNon-metallic\nNon-ferrous\nFig. 3.2: Classification of Minerals\nExtraction of Minerals\nMining\nOpen cast\nmining\nDrilling\nShaft\nmining\nQuarrying\nFig. 3.3: Extraction of Minerals\nMetallic minerals contain metal in raw form. Metals are\nhard substances that conduct heat and electricity and\nhave a characteristic lustre or shine. Iron ore, bauxite,\nmanganese ore are some examples. Metallic minerals\nmay be fer rous or non-ferrous. Ferrous minerals like\niron ore, manganese and chromites contain iron. A\nnon-ferrous mineral does not contain iron but may contain\nsome other metal such as gold, silver, copper or lead.\nNon-metallic minerals do not contain metals.\nLimestone, mica and gypsum are examples of such\nminerals. The mineral fuels like coal and petroleum are\nalso non-metallic minerals.\nMinerals can be extracted by mining, drilling or\nquarrying (Fig 3.3).\nThe process of taking out minerals from rocks buried\nunder the earth’s surface is called mining. Minerals that\nlie at shallow depths are taken out by removing the surface\nlayer; this is known as open-cast mining. Deep bores, called\nshafts, have to be made to reach mineral deposits that lie\nat great depths. This is called shaft mining. Petroleum\nand natural gas occur far below the earth’s surface. Deep\nwells are bored to take them out, this is called drilling\n(Fig 3.4). Minerals that lie near the surface are simply dug\nout, by the process known as quarrying.\nFig. 3.4: Off shore\ndrilling of oil\nMineral and Power Resources     23\n2021–22",

Iron-ore in\nnorth Sweden, copper and nickel deposits in Ontario,\nCanada, iron, nickel, chromites and platinum in South\nAfrica are examples of minerals found in igneous and\nmetamorphic rocks. Sedimentary rock formations of\nplains and young fold mountains contain non-metallic\nminerals like limestone.

It takes\nthousands of years for the formation and concentration\nof minerals. The rate of formation is much smaller than\nthe rate at which the humans consume these minerals.\nIt is necessary to reduce wastage in the process of\nmining. Recycling of metals is another way in which the\nmineral resources can be conserved.\nPower Resources\nSunny’s mother begins her day by switching on the\ngeyser.

Come and\nhave your breakfast”, calls out mother while preparing\nbreakfast on the gas stove for Sunny.\nWhile going to school Sunny forgets to switch off\nlights and fans. When mother switches them off she\nthinks that life in the cities may be more comfortable, but\nits dependency on more and more gadgets all of which\nconsume energy has led to a wide gap between the\ndemand and the supply. With the advent of science and\ntechnology the life styles are changing very fast.\nPower or energy plays a vital role in our lives. We also need\npower for industry, agriculture, transport, communication\nand defense. Power resources may be broadly categorised\nas conventional and non-conventional resources.\nConventional Sources\nConventional sources of energy are those which have\nbeen in common use for a long time. Firewood and fossil\nfuels are the two main conventional energy sources.\nFirewood\nIt is widely used for cooking and heating. In our country\nmore than fifty per cent of the energy used by villagers\ncomes from fire wood.\nRemains of plants and animals which were buried\nunder the earth for millions of years got converted by the\nheat and pressure into fossil fuels.

The outputs\nfrom the system include crops, wool, dairy and poultry\nproducts.\nTypes Of Farming\nFarming is practised in various ways across the world.\nDepending upon the geographical conditions, demand\nof produce, labour and level of technology, farming can\nbe classified into two main types. These are subsistence\nfarming and commercial farming.\nSubsistence Farming\nThis type of farming is practised to meet the needs of the\nfarmer’s family. Traditionally, low levels of technology\nand household labour are used to produce on small\noutput. Subsistence farming can be further classified\nas intensive subsistence and primitive subsistence\nfarming.\nIn intensive subsistence agriculture the farmer\ncultivates a small plot of land using simple tools and\nmore labour. Climate with large number of days with\nsunshine and fertile soils permit growing of more than\none crop annually on the same plot. Rice is the main\ncrop. Other crops include wheat, maize, pulses and\noilseeds. Intensive subsistence agriculture is prevalent\nin the thickly populated areas of the monsoon regions\nof south, southeast and east Asia.\nProcesses\nOutputs\nFig 4.2: The farm system of an arable farm\nFig 4.3: Physical and human farm inputs\nHuman\nInputs\nCrops\nInteresting Fact\nOrganic Farming\nIn this type of\nfarming,  organic\nmanure and\nnatural pesticides\nare used instead\nof chemicals.\nNo genetic\nmodification is\ndone  to increase\nthe yield of the\ncrop.\nPloughing\nSowing\nSpraying\nChemicals\nInputs\nMachinery\nSeeds\nSunshine\nTemperature\nSoil\nSlope\nPhysical Inputs\nRainfall\nStorage\nMachinery\nLabour\nChemicals\n2021–22",

These are the areas\nof heavy rainfall and quick regeneration of vegetation.\nA plot of land is cleared by felling the trees and burning\nthem. The ashes are then mixed with the soil and crops\nlike maize, yam, potatoes and cassava are grown. After\nthe soil loses its fertility, the land is abandoned and the\ncultivator moves to a new plot. Shifting cultivation is\nalso known as ‘slash and burn’ agriculture.\nNomadic herding is practised in the semi-arid\nand arid regions of Sahara, Central Asia and some\nparts of India, like Rajasthan and Jammu and\nKashmir. In this type of farming, herdsmen\nmove from place to place with their animals for\nfodder and water, along defined routes. This\ntype of movement arises in response to climatic\nconstraints and terrain. Sheep, camel, yak and\ngoats are most commonly reared. They provide\nmilk, meat, wool, hides and other products to\nthe herders and their families.\nCommercial Farming\nIn commercial farming  crops are grown and\nanimals are reared for sale in market. The area\ncultivated and the amount of capital used is\nlarge. Most of the work is done by machines.\nCommercial\nfarming\nincludes\ncommercial\ngrain farming, mixed farming and plantation\nagriculture (Fig 4.5).\nIn commercial grain farming crops are grown\nfor commercial purpose. Wheat and maize are\ncommon commercially grown grains. Major\nareas where commercial grain farming is\npracised are temperate grasslands of North America,\nEurope and Asia. These areas are sparsely populated\nwith large farms spreading over hundreds of hectares.\nSevere winters restrict the growing season and only a\nsingle crop can be grown.\nIn mixed farming the land is used for growing\nfood\nand\nfodder\ncrops\nand\nrearing\nlivestock.\nFig 4.4: Nomadic Herders with\ntheir camels\nFig 4.5: A Sugarcane\nplantation\n2021–22",

This can be achieved in many ways such as\nincreasing the cropped area, the number of crops grown,\nimproving irrigation facilities, use of fertilisers and high\nyielding variety of seeds. Mechanisation of agriculture\nis also another aspect of agricultural development. The\nultimate aim of agricultural development is to increase\nfood security.\nAgriculture has developed at different places in different\nparts of the world. Developing countries with large\npopulations usually practise intensive agriculture where\ncrops are grown on small holdings mostly for subsistence.\nLarger holdings are more suitable for commercial agriculture\nas in USA, Canada and Australia. With the help of two case\nstudies of farms — one from India and the other from the\nUSA, let us understand about agriculture in the developing\nand a developed country.\nA Farm in India\nThere is a small village Adilabad in Ghazipur district of\nUttar Pradesh. Munna Lal is a small farmer in this village\nwho has farmland of about 1.5 hectares. His house is in\nthe main village. He purchases high yielding varieties of\nseeds from the market every alternate year. The\nland is fertile and he grows atleast two crops\nin a year which are normally wheat or rice and\npulses. The farmer takes advice of his friends\nand elders as well as government agricultural\nofficers regarding farming practices. He takes\na tractor on rent for ploughing his field, though\nsome of his friends still use traditional method\nof using bullocks for ploughing. There is a\ntubewell in the nearby field which he takes on\nrent to irrigate his field.\n2021–22",

Special alloys of steel can be\nmade by adding small amounts of other metals\nsuch as aluminium, nickel, and copper. Alloys give\nsteel unusual hardness, toughness, or ability to\nresist rust.\nSteel is often called the backbone of modern\nindustry. Almost everything we use is either made\nof iron or steel or has been made with tools and\nmachinery of these metals. Ships, trains, trucks,\nand autos are made largely of steel. Even the safety\npins and the needles you use are made from steel.\nOil wells are drilled with steel machinery. Steel\npipelines transport oil. Minerals are mined with\nsteel equipment. Farm machines are mostly steel.\nLarge buildings have steel framework.\nBefore 1800 A.D. iron and steel industry was\nlocated where raw materials, power supply and\nrunning water were easily\navailable.\nLater\nthe\nideal\nlocation for the industry was\nnear coal fields and close to\ncanals and railways. After\n1950, iron and steel industry\nbegan to be located on large\nareas of flat land near sea\nports.

The world population\nhas not been stable. It has increased manifold as seen\nin the Fig 6.3. Why?  This is actually due to changes in\nthe number of births and deaths.  For an extremely long\nperiod of human history, until the 1800s, the world’s\npopulation grew steadily but slowly. Large numbers of\nbabies were born, but they died early too. This was as\nthere were no proper health facilities. Sufficient food was\nnot available for all the people. Farmers were not able\nto produce enough to meet the food requirements of all\nthe people. As a result the total increase in population\nwas very low.\nIn 1804, the world’s population reached one\nbillion. A hundred and fifty five years later, in 1959,\nthe world’s population reached 3 billion. This is often\ncalled population explosion. In 1999, 40 years later,\nthe population doubled to 6 billion. The main reason\nfor this growth was that with better food supplies and\nmedicine, deaths were reducing, while the number of\nbirths still remained fairly high.\nBirths are usually measured using the birth rate i.e.\nthe number of live births per 1,000 people. Deaths are\nusually measured using the death rate i.e. the number\nof deaths per 1,000 people. Migrations is the movement\nof people in and out of an area.\nBirths and deaths are the\nnatural causes of population\nchange. The difference between\nthe birth rate and the death\nrate of a country is called the\nnatural growth rate.\nThe population increase in\nthe world is mainly due to rapid\nincrease in natural growth rate.\nGlossary\nLife expectancy\nIt is the number\nof years that an\naverage person can\nexpect to live.\nFig 6.3: World Population Growth\n2021–22",

The\nnumbers of children (below 15 years) are shown at the\nbottom and reflect the level of births. The size of the\ntop shows the numbers of aged people (above 65 years)\nand reflects the number of deaths.\nThe population pyramid also tells us how many\ndependents there are in a country. There are two groups\nof dependents — young dependents (aged below 15 years)\nand elderly dependents (aged over 65 years). Those of the\nworking age are the economically active.\nThe population pyramid of a country in which birth\nand death rates bothe are high is broad at the base and\nrapidly narrows towards the top. This is because although,\nmany children are born, a\nlarge percentage of them die\nin their infancy, relatively\nfew become adults and there\nare very few old people. This\nsituation is typified by the\npyramid shown for Kenya\n(Fig 6.7).\nIn\ncountries\nwhere\ndeath\nrates\n(especially\namongst the very young)\nare decreasing, the pyramid\nis broad in the younger\nage groups, because\nmore infants survive\nto adulthood. This can be seen in the pyramid\nfor India (Fig 6.8). Such populations contain a\nrelatively large number of young people and which\nmeans a strong and expanding labour force.\nIn countries like Japan, low birth rates make\nthe pyramid narrow at the base (Fig 6.9). Decreased\ndeath rates allow numbers of people to reach\nold age.\nSkilled, spirited and hopeful young people\nendowed with a positive outlook are the future of\nany nation. We in India are fortunate to have such\na resource. They must be educated and provided\nskills and opportunities to become able and\nproductive.\nFig. 6.7: Population\nPyramid of Kenya\nFig. 6.8: Population Pyramid\nof India\nFig. 6.9: Population Pyramid\nof Japan\n2021–22",
