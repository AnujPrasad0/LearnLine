        "FOREWORD",
        "The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that children’s life at school",
        "must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a departure from the",
        "legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between",
        "the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF",
        "signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning",
        "and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these",
        "measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of",
        "education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).",
        "The success of this efforts depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will",
        "take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities",
        "and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate",
        "new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating",
        "the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other",
        "resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if",
        "we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of",
        "knowledge.",
        "These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning.",
        "Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual",
        "calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching.",
        "The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook",
        "proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of",
        "stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden",
        "by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration",
        "for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance",
        "this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and",
        "wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.",
        "The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates the",
        "hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this book. We wish",
        "to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in Social Sciences, Professor Hari Vasudevan",
        "and the Chief Advisor for this book, Vibha Parthasarathi for guiding the work of this",
        "committee. Several teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful",
        "to their principals for making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and",
        "organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material",
        "and personnel. We are especially grateful to the members of the National Monitoring",

        "How wonderful it is to watch the sky after sunset! One",

        "You cannot count them any more. The whole sky is",
        "filled with tiny shining objects – some are bright, others",
        "dim. It seems as if the sky is studded with diamonds.",
        "They all appear to be twinkling. But if you look at",
        "them carefully you will notice that some of them do",
        "not twinkle as others do. They simply glow without",
        "any flicker just as the moon shines.",
        "Along with these bright objects, you may also see",
        "the moon on most of the days. It may, however, appear",
        "at different times, in different shapes and at different",
        "positions. You can see the full moon only once in about",
        "a month’s time. It is Full moon night or Poornima. A",
        "fortnight later, you cannot see it at all. It is a New",
        "moon night or Amavasya. On this day, you can watch",
        "the night sky best, provided it is a clear night.",
        "Do you wonder why can’t we see the moon and all",
        "those bright tiny objects during day time? It is because",

        "all these bright objects of the night sky.",
        "The sun, the moon and all those objects shining in",
        "the night sky are called celestial bodies.",
        "Some celestial bodies  are very big and hot. They",
        "are made up of gases. They have their own heat and",
        "light, which they emit in large amounts. These celestial",
        "bodies are called stars. The sun is a star.",
        "Countless twinkling stars in the night sky are",
