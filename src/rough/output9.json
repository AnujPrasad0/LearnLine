This principle\nmarks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to\nshape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and community.\nThe syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt\nto implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning\nand the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas.\nWe hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of\na child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on\nEducation (1986).\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and\nteachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and\nto pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognize that, given\nspace, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with\nthe information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook\nas the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources\nand sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible\nif we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers\nof a fixed body of knowledge.\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of\nfunctioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in\nimplementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching\ndays are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and\nevaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making\nchildren’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or\nboredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular\nburden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with\ngreater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching.\nThe textbook attempts to enhance this endeavor by giving higher priority\nand space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in\nsmall groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.\nNCERT appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development\ncommittee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of\nthe Advisory Group on Social Science, Professor Hari Vasudevan and the\nChief Advisor for this book, Professor Neeladri Bhattacharya for guiding\nthe work of this committee. Several teachers contributed to the development\n\n-- 3 of 189 --\n\nof this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for making this\npossible. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations, which\nhave generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and\npersonnel. We are especially grateful to the members of the National\nMonitoring Committee, appointed by the Department of Secondary and\nHigher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development under\nthe Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri and Professor G. P.\nDeshpande, for their valuable time and contribution. As an organisation\ncommitted to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality\nof its products, NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which will\nenable us to undertake further revision and refinement.\nDirector\nNew Delhi \tNational Council of Educational\n20 December 2005 \tResearch and Training\niv\n\n-- 4 of 189 --\n\nAs we live our life in the present and read about the happenings around the world in\nnewspapers, we do not usually pause to think about the longer history of these\nevents. We see change before our eyes, but do not always ask, why are things changing?\nVery often we do not even notice that things were not the same in the past. History\nis about tracking these changes, understanding how and why they are taking place,\nhow the present world in which we live has evolved.\nThe focus of the history books of Classes IX and X is on the emergence of the contemporary\nworld. In earlier classes (VI – VIII) you have read about the history of India. In the next\ntwo years (Classes IX and X) you will see how the story of India’s pasts is related to the\nlarger history of the world. We cannot understand what was happening within India unless\nwe see this connection. This is particularly true about a world in which economies and\nsocieties have become increasingly inter-connected. History cannot be always contained\nwithin defined territorial boundaries.\nIn any case there is no reason to think of national territorial boundaries as the only valid unit\nof our study. There are times when a focus on a small region - a locality, a village, an island,\na desert tract, a forest, a mountain - helps us understand the rich variety in people’s lives and\nhistories that make up the life of the nation. We cannot talk of the nation without the\npeople, nor the locality without the nation. Borrowing from the statement of a famous\nFrench historian, Fernand Braudel, we may also say: it is not possible to talk of the nation\nwithout the world.\nThe textbooks you will read in the next two years will combine these different levels of\nfocus. We move between a close focus on particular communities and regions to the\nhistory of the nation; between the histories as they unfold in India and Europe to the\ndevelopments in Africa and Indonesia. \tOur focus will shift according\nto themes.\nWhat are these themes and how are they organised? What is the logic behind the\nchoices of themes?\nAll too often in the past, the history of the modern world was associated with the\nhistory of the west. It was as if change and progress happened only in the west. As if\nthe histories of other countries were frozen in time, they were motionless and static.\nPeople in the west were seen as enterprising, innovative, scientific, industrious, efficient\nand willing to change. People in the east - or in Africa and South America - were\nconsidered traditional, lazy, superstitious, and resistant to change.\nFor many years now these notions have been questioned by historians. We know\nnow that every society has had its history of change. So in understanding the making\nof the modern world we have to look at the way different societies experienced and\nHistory and a Changing World\n\n-- 5 of 189 --\n\nfashioned these changes. We have to see how the histories of these different countries\nwere inter-linked. Changes in one society shaped the other; developments in India and\nother colonies impacted on Europe. The contemporary world was not shaped by the\nwest alone.\nSo the history of the contemporary world is not only about the growth of\nindustries and trade, technology and science, railways and roads. It is equally\nabout the forest dwellers and pastoralists, shifting cultivators and small peasants.\nAll these social groups in diverse ways have played their part in making the\ncontemporary world what it is. And it is this varied world which you will learn\nabout this year.\nThe textbooks of Classes IX and X have eight chapters each, divided into three\nsections. We hope you will enjoy reading all the chapters. But you are requried\nto read only five chapters: two each from Sections I and II, and one from\nSection III.\nSection I, in both books, focuses on some of the events and processes that are critical\nto the understanding of the modern world. This year you will read about the French\nRevolution, the Russian Revolution and Nazism in this section. Next year you will\nknow about nationalism and anti-colonial movements, in India and elsewhere.\nSection II will move from dramatic events to the routines of people’s lives – their\neconomic activities and livelihood patterns. You will see what the contemporary\nworld has meant for forest people, pastoralists and peasants; and how they have\ncoped with and defined the nature of these changes. Next year you will read\nmore about the processes of industrialisation and urbanisation, capitalism\nand colonialism.\nSection III will introduce you to histories of everyday life. You will read about\nthe history of sport and clothing (Class IX) and about printing and reading, novels and\nnewspapers (Class X). Why should we study the history of sport and clothing, you\nmight ask. Do we not read about them every day in newspapers and magazines?\nTrue, we read a lot about such issues. But what we read does not tell us about their\nhistories. They give us no idea of how things have evolved and why they change. Once\nwe learn to ask historical questions about all that is around us, history in fact acquires a\nnew meaning. It allows us to see everyday things from a different angle. We realise that\neven seemingly ordinary things have a history that is important for us to know.\nTo know how the contemporary world has evolved we will therefore move from\nIndia to Africa, from Europe to Indonesia. We will read both about the big events\nand important ideas, as well as everyday life. In the process of these journeys you\nwill discover how history can be exciting, how it can help us understand the world\nin which we live.\nNeeladri Bhattacharya\nChief Advisor - History\nvi\n\n-- 6 of 189 --\n\nMonica Juneja, Professor, Maria-Goeppert-Mayer Guest Professor,\nHistorisches Seminar, University of Hanover, Germany (Chapter 1).\nVandana Joshi, Lecturer, Venkateswara College, University of Delhi,\nNew Delhi (Chapter 3).\nNandini Sundar, Professor, Department of Sociology, Delhi School of\nEconomics, University of Delhi, Delhi(Chapter 4).\nMukul Kesavan, Professor, Department of History, Jamia Millia Islamia,\nNew Delhi (Chapter 7).\nJanaki Nair, Professor, Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Kolkata (Chapter 8).\nRekha Krishnan, Head of Senior School, Vasant Valley School, New Delhi\nRashmi Paliwal, Eklavya, Hoshangabad, Madhya Pradesh.\nAjay Dandekar, Visiting fellow, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai.\nPritish Acharya, Reader, Regional Institute of Education, Bhubaneswar,\nOrissa.\nMember–Coordinator\nKiran Devendra, Professor, Department of Elementary Education, NCERT,\nNew Delhi.\nC HAIRPERSON , A DVISORY G ROUP FOR T EXTBOOKS IN S OCIAL S CIENCE FOR THE\nS ECONDARY S TAGE\nHari Vasudevan, Professor, Department of History, Calcutta University, Kolkata\n(Chapter 2).\nC HIEF A DVISOR\nNeeladri Bhattacharya, Professor, Centre for Historical Studies, School of Social\nSciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi (Chapters 5 and 6).\nMembers\nTextbook Development Committee\n\n-- 7 of 189 --\n\n\n\n-- 8 of 189 --\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis book is the result of a collective effort of a large number of historians,\nteachers, and educationalists.

In different ways all these events were important in the\nmaking of the modern world.\nChapter I is on the French Revolution. Today we often take the ideas of liberty,\nfreedom and equality for granted. But we need to remind ourselves that these ideas\nalso have a history. By looking at the French Revolution you will read a small part\nof that history. The French Revolution led to the end of monarchy in France. A\nsociety based on privileges gave way to a new system of governance. The Declaration\nof the Rights of Man during the revolution, announced the coming of a new time.\nThe idea that all individuals had rights and could claim equality became part of a\nnew language of politics. These notions of equality and freedom emerged as the central\nideas of a new age; but in different countries they were reinterpreted and rethought\nin many different ways. The anti-colonial movements in India and China, Africa and\nSouth America, produced ideas that were innovative and original, but they spoke in\na language that gained currency only from the late eighteenth century.\nIn Chapter II, you will read about the coming of socialism in Europe, and the dramatic\nevents that forced the ruling monarch, Tsar Nicholas II, to give up power. The Russian\nRevolution sought to change society in a different way. It raised the question of\neconomic equality and the well-being of workers and peasants. The chapter will tell\nyou about the changes that were initiated by the new Soviet government, the problems\nit faced and the measures it undertook. While Soviet Russia pushed ahead with\nindustrialisation and mechanisation of agriculture, it denied the rights of citizens\nthat were essential to the working of a democratic society. The ideals of socialism,\nEVENTS AND PROCESSES\nSECTION \tI\nEVENTS AND PROCESSES\n\n-- 12 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n2\nhowever, became part of the anti-colonial movements in different countries. Today\nthe Soviet Union has broken up and socialism is in crisis but through the twentieth\ncentury it has been a powerful force in the shaping of the contemporary world.\nChapter III will take you to Germany. It will discuss the rise of Hitler and the\npolitics of Nazism. You will read about the children and women in Nazi Germany,\nabout schools and concentration camps. You will see how Nazism denied various\nminorities a right to live, how it drew upon a long tradition of anti-Jewish feelings\nto persecute the Jews, and how it waged a relentless battle against democracy and\nsocialism. But the story of Nazismís rise is not only about a few specific events,\nabout massacres and killings. It is about the working of an elaborate and frightening\nsystem which operated at different levels. Some in India were impressed with the\nideas of Hitler but most watched the rise of Nazism with horror.\nThe history of the modern world is not simply a story of the unfolding of freedom\nand democracy. It has also been a story of violence and tyranny, death and destruction.\n\n-- 13 of 189 --\n\nT h e\n \nF r e n c h\n \nR e v o l u t i o n\n3\nOn the morning of 14 July 1789, the city of Paris was in a state of\nalarm. The king had commanded troops to move into the city. Rumours\nspread that he would soon order the army to open fire upon the citizens.\nSome 7,000 men and women gathered in front of the town hall and\ndecided to form a peoplesí militia. They broke into a number of\ngovernment buildings in search of arms.\nFinally, a group of several hundred people marched towards the eastern\npart of the city and stormed the fortress-prison, the Bastille, where they\nhoped to find hoarded ammunition. In the armed fight that followed,\nthe commander of the Bastille was killed and the prisoners released ñ\nthough there were only seven of them. Yet the Bastille was hated by all,\nbecause it stood for the despotic power of the king. The fortress was\ndemolished and its stone fragments were sold in the markets to all\nthose who wished to keep a souvenir of its destruction.\nThe days that followed saw more rioting both in Paris and the\ncountryside. Most people were protesting against the high price of bread.\nMuch later, when historians looked back upon this time, they saw it as\nthe beginning of a chain of events that ultimately led to the execution\nof the king in France, though most people at the time did not anticipate\nthis outcome. How and why did this happen?\nThe French Revolution\tThe French Revolution\tThe French Revolution\tThe French Revolution\tThe French Revolution\nT h e\n \nF r e n c h\n \nR e v o l u t i o n\nFig.1 ñ Storming of the Bastille.\nSoon after the demolition of the Bastille,\nartists made prints commemorating the event.\nChapter I\n\n-- 14 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n4\nIn 1774, Louis XVI of the Bourbon family of kings ascended the\nthrone of France. He was 20 years old and married to the Austrian\nprincess Marie Antoinette. Upon his accession the new king found\nan empty treasury. Long years of war had drained the financial\nresources of France. Added to this was the cost of maintaining an\nextravagant court at the immense palace of Versailles. Under Louis\nXVI, France helped the thirteen American colonies to gain their\nindependence from the common enemy, Britain. The war added more\nthan a billion livres to a debt that had already risen to more than 2\nbillion livres. Lenders who gave the state credit, now began to charge\n10 per cent interest on loans. So the French government was obliged\nto spend an increasing percentage of its budget on interest payments\nalone. To meet its regular expenses, such as the cost of maintaining\nan army, the court, running government offices or universities, the\nstate was forced to increase taxes. Yet even this measure would not\nhave sufficed. French society in the eighteenth century was divided\ninto three estates, and only members of the third estate paid taxes.\nThe society of estates was part of the feudal system that dated back to\nthe middle ages. The term Old Regime is usually used to describe the\nsociety and institutions of France before 1789.\nFig. 2 shows how the system of estates in French society was organised.\nPeasants made up about 90 per cent of the population. However,\nonly a small number of them owned the land they cultivated. About\n60 per cent of the land was owned by nobles, the Church and other\nricher members of the third estate. The members of the first two\nestates, that is, the clergy and the nobility, enjoyed certain privileges by\nbirth. The most important of these was exemption from paying taxes to\nthe state. The nobles further enjoyed feudal privileges. These included\nfeudal dues, which they extracted from the peasants. Peasants were obliged\nto render services to the lord ñ to work in his house and fields ñ to serve\nin the army or to participate in building roads.\nThe Church too extracted its share of taxes called tithes from the peasants,\nand finally, all members of the third estate had to pay taxes to the state.\nThese included a direct tax, called taille, and a number of indirect taxes\nwhich were levied on articles of everyday consumption like salt or tobacco.\nThe burden of financing activities of the state through taxes was borne\nby the third estate alone.\nNew words\nLivre ñ Unit of currency in France,\ndiscontinued in 1794\nClergy ñ Group of persons invested with\nspecial functions in the church\nTithe ñ A tax levied by the church, comprising\none-tenth of the agricultural produce\nTaille ñ Tax to be paid directly to the state\n1 French Society During the Late Eighteenth Century\nClergy\nNobility\nPeasants and\nartisans\nSmall peasants,\nlandless labour,\nservants\nBig businessmen,\nmerchants, court\nofficials, lawyers etc.\nFig.2 ñ A Society of Estates.\nNote that within the Third Estate some were\nrich and others poor.\n1st estate\n3rd estate\n2nd estate\n\n-- 15 of 189 --\n\nT h e\n \nF r e n c h\n \nR e v o l u t i o n\n5\nëThis poor fellow brings everything,\ngrain, fruits, money, salad.

This led to a rapid increase in the demand for\nfoodgrains. Production of grains could not keep pace with the\ndemand. So the price of bread which was the staple diet of the majority\nrose rapidly. Most workers were employed as labourers in workshops\nwhose owner fixed their wages. But wages did not keep pace with\nthe rise in prices. So the gap between the poor and the rich widened.\nThings became worse whenever drought or hail reduced the harvest.\nThis led to a subsistence crisis, something that occurred frequently\nin France during the Old Regime.\nNew words\nSubsistence crisis ñ An extreme situation where\nthe basic means of livelihood are endangered\nAnonymous ñ One whose name remains\nunknown\n\n-- 16 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n6\nActivity\n1.2 How a Subsistence Crisis Happens\nFill in the blank boxes in Fig. 4 with\nappropriate terms from among the following:\nFood riots, scarcity of grain, increased\nnumber of deaths, rising food prices,\nweaker bodies.\n1.3 A Growing Middle Class Envisages an End to Privileges\nIn the past, peasants and workers had participated in revolts against\nincreasing taxes and food scarcity. But they lacked the means and\nprogrammes to carry out full-scale measures that would bring about\na change in the social and economic order. This was left to those\ngroups within the third estate who had become prosperous and had\naccess to education and new ideas.\nThe eighteenth century witnessed the emergence of social groups,\ntermed the middle class, who earned their wealth through an\nexpanding overseas trade and from the manufacture of goods such as\nwoollen and silk textiles that were either exported or bought by the\nricher members of society. In addition to merchants and\nmanufacturers, the third estate included professions such as lawyers\nor administrative officials. All of these were educated and believed\nthat no group in society should be privileged by birth. Rather, a\npersonís social position must depend on his merit. These ideas\nenvisaging a society based on freedom and equal laws and\nopportunities for all, were put forward by philosophers such as John\nLocke and Jean Jacques Rousseau. In his Two Treatises of Government,\nLocke sought to refute the doctrine of the divine and absolute right\nFig.4 ñ The course of a subsistence crisis.\nThe poorest can no\nlonger buy bread\nBad\nharvest\nDisease\nepidemics\n\n-- 17 of 189 --\n\nT h e\n \nF r e n c h\n \nR e v o l u t i o n\n7\nSource A\nAccounts of lived experiences in the Old Regime\n1. Georges Danton, who later became active in revolutionary politics, wrote to a friend in\n1793, looking back upon the time when he had just completed his studies:\nëI was educated in the residential college of Plessis. There I was in the company of\nimportant men Ö Once my studies ended, I was left with nothing. I started looking for a\npost. It was impossible to find one at the law courts in Paris. The choice of a career in the\narmy was not open to me as I was not a noble by birth, nor did I have a patron. The\nchurch too could not offer me a refuge. I could not buy an office as I did not possess a\nsou. My old friends turned their backs to me Ö the system had provided us with an\neducation wi thout however offering a field where our talents could be utilised.í\n2. An Englishman, Arthur Young, travelled thr ough France during the years from 1787 to\n1789 and wrote detailed descriptions of his journeys. He often commented on what he\nsaw.\nëHe who decides to be served and waited upon by slaves, ill-treated slaves at that, must\nbe fully aware that by doing so he is placing his property and his life in a situation which is\nvery different from that he would be in, had he chosen the services of free and well-\ntreated men. And he who chooses to dine to the accompaniment of his victimsí groans,\nshould not complain i f during a riot his daughter gets kidnapped or his sonís throat is slit.í\nWhat message is Young trying to convey here? Whom does he mean when he speaks ofë ëslavesí?\nWho is he criticising? What dangers does he sense in the situation of 1787?\nActivity\nof the monarch. Rousseau carried the idea forward, proposing a\nform of government based on a social contract between people\nand their representatives. In The Spirit of the Laws, Montesquieu\nproposed a division of power within the government between\nthe legislative, the executive and the judiciary. This model of\ngovernment was put into force in the USA, after the thirteen\ncolonies declared their independence from Britain. The American\nconstitution and its guarantee of individual rights was an important\nexample for political thinkers in France.\nThe ideas of these philosophers were discussed intensively in salons\nand coffee-houses and spread among people through books and\nnewspapers. These were frequently read aloud in groups for the\nbenefit of those who could not read and write. The news that\nLouis XVI planned to impose further taxes to be able to meet the\nexpenses of the state generated anger and protest against the system\nof privileges.\nSource\n\n-- 18 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n8\nLouis XVI had to increase taxes for reasons you have learnt in the\nprevious section. How do you think he could have gone about doing\nthis? In France of the Old Regime the monarch did not have the\npower to impose taxes according to his will alone. Rather he had to\ncall a meeting of the Estates General which would then pass his\nproposals for new taxes. The Estates General was a political body to\nwhich the three estates sent their representatives. However, the\nmonarch alone could decide when to call a meeting of this body. The\nlast time it was done was in 1614.\nOn 5 May 1789, Louis XVI called together an assembly of the Estates\nGeneral to pass proposals for new taxes. A resplendent hall in\nVersailles was prepared to host the delegates. The first and second\nestates sent 300 representatives each, who were seated in rows facing\neach other on two sides, while the 600 members of the third estate\nhad to stand at the back. The third estate was represented by its more\nprosperous and educated members. Peasants, artisans and women\nwere denied entry to the assembly. However, their grievances and\ndemands were listed in some 40,000 letters which the representatives\nhad brought with them.\nVoting in the Estates General in the past had been conducted according\nto the principle that each estate had one vote. This time too Louis\nXVI was determined to continue the same practice. But members of\nthe third estate demanded that voting now be conducted by the\nassembly as a whole, where each member would have one vote. This\nwas one of the democratic principles put forward by philosophers\nlike Rousseau in his book The Social Contract. When the king rejected\nthis proposal, members of the third estate walked out of the assembly\nin protest.\nThe representatives of the third estate viewed themselves as spokesmen\nfor the whole French nation. On 20 June they assembled in the hall\nof an indoor tennis court in the grounds of Versailles. They declared\nthemselves a National Assembly and swore not to disperse till they\nhad drafted a constitution for France that would limit the powers of\nthe monarch. They were led by Mirabeau and AbbÈ SieyËs. Mirabeau\nwas born in a noble family but was convinced of the need to do away\nwith a society of feudal privilege.

A severe winter\nhad meant a bad harvest; the price of bread rose, often bakers exploited\nthe situation and hoarded supplies.

A large number of nobles fled from their\nhomes, many of them migrating to neighbouring countries.\nFaced with the power of his revolting subjects, Louis XVI finally\naccorded recognition to the National Assembly and accepted the\nprinciple that his powers would from now on be checked by a\nconstitution. On the night of 4 August 1789, the Assembly passed a\ndecree abolishing the feudal system of obligations and taxes. Members\nof the clergy too were forced to give up their privileges.

Its main object was to limit the powers of the monarch. These\npowers instead of being concentrated in the hands of one person,\nwere now separated and assigned to different institutions ñ the\nlegislature, executive and judiciary. This made France a constitutional\nmonarchy. Fig. 7 explains how the new political system worked.\nThe Constitution of 1791 vested the power to make laws in the\nNational Assembly, which was indirectly elected. That is, citizens\nvoted for a group of electors, who in turn chose the Assembly. Not\nall citizens, however, had the right to vote. Only men above 25 years\nof age who paid taxes equal to at least 3 days of a labourerís wage\nwere given the status of active citizens, that is, they were entitled to\nvote. The remaining men and all women were classed as passive\ncitizens. To qualify as an elector and then as a member of the Assembly,\na man had to belong to the highest bracket of taxpayers.\nFig.7 ñ The Political sytstem under the Constitution of 1791.\nJudiciary \tExecutive \tLegislature\nJudge \tKing \tNational Assembly (745 members)\nElectors (50,000 men)\tMinisters\nActive citizens: entitled to vote.

Rulers of other neighbouring\ncountries too were worried by the developments in France and made\nplans to send troops to put down the events that had been taking place\nthere since the summer of 1789. Before this could happen, the National\nAssembly voted in April 1792 to declare war against Prussia and Austria.\nThousands of volunteers thronged from the provinces to join the army.\nThey saw this as a war of the people against kings and aristocracies all\nover Europe. Among the patriotic songs they sang was the Marseillaise,\ncomposed by the poet Roget de LíIsle. It was sung for the first time by\nvolunteers from Marseilles as they marched into Paris and so got its\nname. The Marseillaise is now the national anthem of France.\nThe revolutionary wars brought losses and economic difficulties\nto the people. While the men were away fighting at the front,\nwomen were left to cope with the tasks of earning a living and\nlooking after their families. Large sections of the population were\nconvinced that the revolution had to be carried further, as the\nConstitution of 1791 gave political rights only to the richer sections\nof society. Political clubs became an important rallying point for\npeople who wished to discuss government policies and plan their\nown forms of action. The most successful of these clubs was that of\nthe Jacobins, which got its name from the former convent of St\nJacob in Paris. Women too, who had been active throughout this\nperiod, formed their own clubs. Section 4 of this chapter will tell\nyou more about their activities and demands.\nThe members of the Jacobin club belonged mainly to the less\nprosperous sections of society. They included small shopkeepers,\nartisans such as shoemakers, pastry cooks, watch-makers, printers,\nas well as servants and daily-wage workers. Their leader was\nMaximilian Robespierre. A large group among the Jacobins decided\nto start wearing long striped trousers similar to those worn by\ndock workers. This was to set themselves apart from the fashionable\nsections of society, especially nobles, who wore knee breeches.

These Jacobins came to be known as the\nsans-culottes, literally meaning ëthose without knee breechesí. Sans-\nculottes men wore in addition the red cap that symbolised liberty.\nWomen however were not allowed to do so.\nIn the summer of 1792 the Jacobins planned an insurrection of a\nlarge number of Parisians who were angered by the short supplies\nand high prices of food. On the morning of August 10 they stormed\nthe Palace of the Tuileries, massacred the kingís guards and held\nthe king himself as hostage for several hours.

Robespierre followed a policy of severe control and\npunishment. All those whom he saw as being ëenemiesí of the\nrepublic ñ ex-nobles and clergy, members of other political\nparties, even members of his own party who did not agree with\nhis methods ñ were arrested, imprisoned and then tried by a\nrevolutionary tribunal.

It was named\nafter Dr Guillotin who invented it.\nRobespierreís government issued laws placing a maximum ceiling\non wages and prices. Meat and bread were rationed. Peasants\nwere forced to transport their grain to the cities and sell it at\nprices fixed by the government. The use of more expensive white\nflour was forbidden; all citizens were required to eat the pain\ndíÈgalitÈ (equality bread), a loaf made of wholewheat. Equality\nwas also sought to be practised through forms of speech and\naddress. Instead of the traditional Monsieur (Sir) and Madame\n(Madam) all French men and women were henceforth Citoyen\nand Citoyenne (Citizen). Churches were shut down and their\nbuildings converted into barracks or offices.\nRobespierre pursued his policies so relentlessly that even his\nsupporters began to demand moderation. Finally, he was\nconvicted by a court in July 1794, arrested and on the next day\nsent to the guillotine.\n\n-- 27 of 189 --\n\nT h e\n \nF r e n c h\n \nR e v o l u t i o n\n17\nFig.11 ñ The revolutionary government sought to mobilise the loyalty of its subjects through various means ñ one of\nthem was the staging of festivals like this one.

A new constitution was introduced which\ndenied the vote to non-propertied sections of society. It provided\nfor two elected legislative councils. These then appointed a Directory,\nan executive made up of five members. This was meant as a safeguard\nagainst the concentration of power in a one-man executive as under\nthe Jacobins. However, the Directors often clashed with the legislative\ncouncils, who then sought to dismiss them. The political instability\nof the Directory paved the way for the rise of a military dictator,\nNapoleon Bonaparte.\nThrough all these changes in the form of government, the ideals of\nfreedom, of equality before the law and of fraternity remained inspiring\nideals that motivated political movements in France and the rest of Europe\nduring the following century.\n\n-- 28 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n18\n4\t4\t4\t4\t4 Did Women have a Revolution?\tDid Women have a Revolution?\tDid Women have a Revolution?\tDid Women have a Revolution?\tDid Women have a Revolution?\nFig.12 ñ Parisian women on their way to Versailles.\nThis print is one of the many pictorial representations of the events of 5 October 1789, when women marched to Versailles\nand brought the king back with them to Paris.\nFrom the very beginning women were active participants in the events\nwhich brought about so many important changes in French society.\nThey hoped that their involvement would pressurise the revolutionary\ngovernment to introduce measures to improve their lives.

Most women did not have access to education or\njob training. Only daughters of nobles or wealthier members of the\nthird estate could study at a convent, after which their families\narranged a marriage for them. Working women had also to care for\ntheir families, that is, cook, fetch water, queue up for bread and\nlook after the children. Their wages were lower than those of men.\nIn order to discuss and voice their interests women started their own\npolitical clubs and newspapers.

Women were disappointed that the Constitution of 1791 reduced\nthem to passive citizens. They demanded the right to vote, to be\nelected to the Assembly and to hold political office. Only then, they\nfelt, would their interests be represented in the new government.\nIn the early years, the revolutionary government did introduce laws\nthat helped improve the lives of women. Together with the creation\nof state schools, schooling was made compulsory for all girls. Their\nfathers could no longer force them into marriage against their will.\nMarriage was made into a contract entered into freely and registered\nunder civil law. Divorce was made legal, and could be applied for by\nboth women and men. Women could now train for jobs, could\nbecome artists or run small businesses.\nWomenís struggle for equal political rights, however, continued.\nDuring the Reign of Terror, the new government issued laws ordering\nclosure of womenís clubs and banning their political activities. Many\nprominent women were arrested and a number of them executed.\nWomenís movements for voting rights and equal wages continued\nthrough the next two hundred years in many countries of the world.\nThe fight for the vote was carried out through an international\nsuffrage movement during the late nineteenth and early twentieth\ncenturies.

So, in 1791, she wrote a Declaration of the Rights of\nWoman and Citizen, which she addressed to the Queen and to the\nmembers of the National Assembly, demanding that they act upon\nit. In 1793, Olympe de Gouges criticised the Jacobin government\nfor forcibly closing down womenís clubs. She was tried by the\nNational Convention, which charged her with treason.

The colonies in\nthe Caribbean ñ Martinique, Guadeloupe and San Domingo ñ were\nimportant suppliers of commodities such as tobacco, indigo, sugar\nand coffee. But the reluctance of Europeans to go and work in distant\nand unfamiliar lands meant a shortage of labour on the plantations.\nSo this was met by a triangular slave trade between Europe, Africa\nand the Americas. The slave trade began in the seventeenth century.\nFrench merchants sailed from the ports of Bordeaux or Nantes to\nthe African coast, where they bought slaves from local chieftains.\nBranded and shackled, the slaves were packed tightly into ships for\nthe three-month long voyage across the Atlantic to the Caribbean.\nThere they were sold to plantation owners. The exploitation of slave\nlabour made it possible to meet the growing demand in European\nmarkets for sugar, coffee, and indigo. Port cities like Bordeaux and\nNantes owed their economic prosperity to the flourishing slave trade.\nThroughout the eighteenth century there was little criticism of slavery\nin France. The National Assembly held long debates about whether\nthe rights of man should be extended to all French subjects including\nthose in the colonies. But it did not pass any laws, fearing opposition\nfrom businessmen whose incomes depended on the slave trade. It\nwas finally the Convention which in 1794 legislated to free all slaves\nin the French overseas possessions. This, however, turned out to be\na short-term measure: ten years later, Napoleon reintroduced slavery.\nPlantation owners understood their freedom as including the right\nto enslave African Negroes in pursuit of their economic interests.\nSlavery was finally abolished in French colonies in 1848.\nFig.14 ñ The emancipation of slaves.\nThis print of 1794 describes the emancipation\nof slaves.

The years following 1789 in France saw many\nsuch changes in the lives of men, women and children. The\nrevolutionary governments took it upon themselves to pass laws that\nwould translate the ideals of liberty and equality into everyday practice.\nOne important law that came into effect soon after the storming of\nthe Bastille in the summer of 1789 was the abolition of censorship. In\nthe Old Regime all written material and cultural activities ñ books,\nnewspapers, plays ñ could be published or performed only after they\nhad been approved by the censors of the king. Now the Declaration\nof the Rights of Man and Citizen proclaimed freedom of speech and\nexpression to be a natural right. Newspapers, pamphlets, books and\nprinted pictures flooded the towns of France from where they\ntravelled rapidly into the countryside. They all described and discussed\nthe events and changes taking place in France. Freedom of the press\nalso meant that opposing views of events could be expressed. Each\nside sought to convince the others of its position through the medium\nof print. Plays, songs and festive processions attracted large numbers\nof people.

Initially, many\nsaw Napoleon as a liberator who would bring freedom for the people.\nBut soon the Napoleonic armies came to be viewed everywhere as an\ninvading force. He was finally defeated at Waterloo in 1815. Many of his\nmeasures that carried the revolutionary ideas of liberty and modern laws\nto other parts of Europe had an impact on people long after Napoleon\nhad left.\nThe ideas of liberty and democratic rights were the most important\nlegacy of the French Revolution. These spread from France to the\nrest of Europe during the nineteenth century, where feudal systems Fig.17 ñ Napoleon crossing the Alps, painting\nby David.\n\n-- 34 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n24\nBox 2\nActivities\nQuestions\n?\n1.

As you\nhave read, before the eighteenth century society was broadly divided\ninto estates and orders and it was the aristocracy and church which\ncontrolled economic and social power. Suddenly, after the revolution,\nit seemed possible to change this. In many parts of the world including\nEurope and Asia, new ideas about individual rights and who\ncontrolled social power began to be discussed. In India, Raja\nRammohan Roy and Derozio talked of the significance of the French\nRevolution, and many others debated the ideas of post-revolutionary\nEurope. The developments in the colonies, in turn, reshaped these\nideas of societal change.\nNot everyone in Europe, however, wanted a complete transformation\nof society. Responses varied from those who accepted that some\nchange was necessary but wished for a gradual shift, to those who\nwanted to restructure society radically. Some were ëconservativesí,\nothers were ëliberalsí or ëradicalsí. What did these terms really mean\nin the context of the time? What separated these strands of politics\nand what linked them together? We must remember that these terms\ndo not mean the same thing in all contexts or at all times.\nWe will look briefly at some of the important political traditions of\nthe nineteenth century, and see how they influenced change. Then\nwe will focus on one historical event in which there was an attempt\nat a radical transformation of society. Through the revolution in\nRussia, socialism became one of the most significant and powerful\nideas to shape society in the twentieth century.\n1.1 Liberals, Radicals and Conservatives\nOne of the groups which looked to change society were the liberals.\nLiberals wanted a nation which tolerated all religions. We should\nremember that at this time European states usually discriminated in\t\nSocialism in Europe and the Russian Revolution\n \nChapter\n ll\n\n-- 36 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n26\nfavour of one religion or another (Britain favoured the Church of\nEngland, Austria and Spain favoured the Catholic Church). Liberals\nalso opposed the uncontrolled power of dynastic rulers. They wanted\nto safeguard the rights of individuals against governments. They\nargued for a representative, elected parliamentary government, subject\nto laws interpreted by a well-trained judiciary that was independent\nof rulers and officials. However, they were not ëdemocratsí. They\ndid not believe in universal adult franchise, that is, the right of every\ncitizen to vote. They felt men of property mainly should have the\nvote. They also did not want the vote for women.\nIn contrast, radicals wanted a nation in which government was based\non the majority of a countryís population. Many supported womenís\nsuffragette movements. Unlike liberals, they opposed the privileges\nof great landowners and wealthy factory owners. They were not\nagainst the existence of private property but disliked concentration\nof property in the hands of a few.\nConservatives were opposed to radicals and liberals. After the French\nRevolution, however, even conservatives had opened their minds to\nthe need for change. Earlier, in the eighteenth century, conservatives\nhad been generally opposed to the idea of change. By the nineteenth\ncentury, they accepted that some change was inevitable but believed\nthat the past had to be respected and change had to be brought about\nthrough a slow process.\nSuch differing ideas about societal change clashed during the social\nand political turmoil that followed the French Revolution. The\nvarious attempts at revolution and national transformation in the\nnineteenth century helped define both the limits and potential of\nthese political tendencies.\n1.2 Industrial Society and Social Change\nThese political trends were signs of a new time. It was a time of\nprofound social and economic changes. It was a time when new cities\ncame up and new industrialised regions developed, railways expanded\nand the Industrial Revolution occurred.\nIndustrialisation brought men, women and children to factories. Work\nhours were often long and wages were poor. Unemployment was\ncommon, particularly during times of low demand for industrial goods.\nHousing and sanitation were problems since towns were growing\nrapidly. Liberals and radicals searched for solutions to these issues.\nNew words\nSuffragette movement ñ A movement to\ngive women the right to vote.\n\n-- 37 of 189 --\n\nSocialism in Europe and the Russian Revolution\n27\nAlmost all industries were the property of individuals. Liberals and\nradicals themselves were often property owners and employers.\nHaving made their wealth through trade or industrial ventures, they\nfelt that such effort should be encouraged ñ that its benefits would\nbe achieved if the workforce in the economy was healthy and citizens\nwere educated. Opposed to the privileges the old aristocracy had by\nbirth, they firmly believed in the value of individual effort, labour\nand enterprise. If freedom of individuals was ensured, if the poor\ncould labour, and those with capital could operate without restraint,\nthey believed that societies would develop. Many working men and\nwomen who wanted changes in the world rallied around liberal and\nradical groups and parties in the early nineteenth century.\nSome nationalists, liberals and radicals wanted revolutions to put an\nend to the kind of governments established in Europe in 1815. In\nFrance, Italy, Germany and Russia, they became revolutionaries and\nworked to overthrow existing monarchs. Nationalists talked of\nrevolutions that would create ënationsí where all citizens would have\nFig.1 ñ The London poor in the mid-nineteenth century as seen by a\ncontemporary.\nFrom: Henry Mayhew, London Labour and the London Poor, 1861.\n\n-- 38 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n28\nActivity\nequal rights. After 1815, Giuseppe Mazzini, an Italian nationalist, conspired\nwith others to achieve this in Italy. Nationalists elsewhere ñ including India\nñ read his writings.\n1.3 The Coming of Socialism to Europe\nPerhaps one of the most far-reaching visions of how society should be\nstructured was socialism. By the mid - nineteenth century in Europe, socialism\nwas a well-known body of ideas that attracted widespread attention.\nSocialists were against private property, and saw it as the root of all social ills\nof the time. Why? Individuals owned the property that gave employment\nbut the propertied were concerned only with personal gain and not with\nthe welfare of those who made the property productive. So if society as a\nwhole rather than single individuals controlled property, more attention\nwould be paid to collective social interests. Socialists wanted this change and\ncampaigned for it.\nHow could a society without property operate? What would be the basis of\nsocialist society?\nSocialists had different visions of the future. Some believed in the idea of\ncooperatives. Robert Owen (1771-1858), a leading English manufacturer,\nsought to build a cooperative community called New Harmony in Indiana\n(USA). Other socialists felt that cooperatives could not be built on a wide\nscale only through individual initiative: they demanded that governments\nencourage cooperatives. In France, for instance, Louis Blanc (1813-1882)\nwanted the government to encourage cooperatives and replace capitalist\nenterprises. These cooperatives were to be associations of people who\nproduced goods together and divided the profits according to the work\ndone by members.\nKarl Marx (1818-1883) and Friedrich Engels (1820-1895) added other ideas\nto this body of arguments. Marx argued that industrial society was ëcapitalistí.\nCapitalists owned the capital invested in factories, and the profit of capitalists\nwas produced by workers. The conditions of workers could not improve\nas long as this profit was accumulated by private capitalists. Workers had to\noverthrow capitalism and the rule of private property. Marx believed that\nto free themselves from capitalist exploitation, workers had to construct a\nradically socialist society where all property was socially controlled. This\nwould be a communist society. He was convinced that workers would\ntriumph in their conflict with capitalists. A communist society was the natural\nsociety of the future.\nList two differences between the capitalist\nand socialist ideas of private property.\n\n-- 39 of 189 --\n\nSocialism in Europe and the Russian Revolution\n29\nActivity\n1.4 Support for Socialism\nBy the 1870s, socialist ideas spread through Europe. To coordinate\ntheir efforts, socialists formed an international body ñ namely, the\nSecond International.\nWorkers in England and Germany began forming associations to\nfight for better living and working conditions. They set up funds to\nhelp members in times of distress and demanded a reduction of working\nhours and the right to vote. In Germany, these associations worked closely\nwith the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and helped it win parliamentary\nseats. By 1905, socialists and trade unionists formed a Labour Party in\nBritain and a Socialist Party in France. However, till 1914, socialists never\nsucceeded in forming a government in Europe. Represented by strong\nfigures in parliamentary politics, their ideas did shape legislation, but\ngovernments continued to be run by conservatives, liberals and radicals.\nImagine that a meeting has been called in\nyour area to discuss the socialist idea of\ndoing away with private property and\nintroducing collective ownership. Write the\nspeech you would make at the meeting if you\nare:\n! a poor labourer working in the fields\n! a medium-level landowner\n! a house owner\nFig.2 ñ This is a painting of the Paris Commune of 1871 (From Illustrated London News, 1871). It portrays a scene from the\npopular uprising in Paris between March and May 1871. This was a period when the town council (commune) of Paris was\ntaken over by a ëpeoplesí governmentí consisting of workers, ordinary people, professionals, political activists and others.\nThe uprising emerged against a background of growing discontent against the policies of the French state. The ëParis\nCommuneí was ultimately crushed by government troops but it was celebrated by Socialists the world over as a prelude to a\nsocialist revolution.The Paris Commune is also popularly remembered for two important legacies: one, for its association with\nthe workersí red flag ñ that was the flag adopted by the communards ( revolutionaries) in Paris; two, for the ëMarseillaiseí,\noriginally written as a war song in 1792, it became a symbol of the Commune and of the struggle for liberty.\n\n-- 40 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n30\n2 The Russian Revolution\nIn one of the least industrialised of European states this situation was\nreversed. Socialists took over the government in Russia through the\nOctober Revolution of 1917. The fall of monarchy in February 1917\nand the events of October are normally called the Russian Revolution.\nHow did this come about? What were the social and political\nconditions in Russia when the revolution occurred? To answer these\nquestions, let us look at Russia a few years before the revolution.\n2.1 The Russian Empire in 1914\nIn 1914, Tsar Nicholas II ruled Russia and its empire. Besides the\nterritory around Moscow, the Russian empire included current-day\nFinland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, parts of Poland, Ukraine and\nBelarus. It stretched to the Pacific and comprised todayís Central\nAsian states, as well as Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. The majority\nreligion was Russian Orthodox Christianity ñ which had grown out\nof the Greek Orthodox Church ñ but the empire also \tincluded\nCatholics, Protestants, Muslims and Buddhists.\nFig.3 ñ Tsar Nicholas II in the White\nHall of the Winter Palace,\nSt Petersburg, 1900.\nPainted by Earnest Lipgart (1847-1932)\nFig.4 ñ Europe in 1914.\nThe map shows the Russian empire and the European countries at war during the First\nWorld War.\n\n-- 41 of 189 --\n\nSocialism in Europe and the Russian Revolution\n31\n2.2 Economy and Society\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, the vast majority of\nRussiaís people were agriculturists. About 85 per cent of the Russian\nempireís population earned their living from agriculture. This\nproportion was higher than in most European countries. For instance,\nin France and Germany the proportion was between 40 per cent and\n50 per cent. In the empire, cultivators produced for the market as\nwell as for their own needs and Russia was a major exporter of grain.\nIndustry was found in pockets. Prominent industrial areas were\nSt Petersburg and Moscow. Craftsmen undertook much of the\nproduction, but large factories existed alongside craft workshops.\nMany factories were set up in the 1890s, when Russiaís railway\nnetwork was extended, and foreign investment in industry increased.\nCoal production doubled and iron and steel output quadrupled. By\nthe 1900s, in some areas factory workers and craftsmen were almost\nequal in number.\nMost industry was the private property of industrialists. Government\nsupervised large factories to ensure minimum wages and limited hours\nof work. But factory inspectors could not prevent rules being broken.\nIn craft units and small workshops, the working day was sometimes\n15 hours, compared with 10 or 12 hours in factories. Accommodation\nvaried from rooms to dormitories.\nWorkers were a divided social group. Some had strong links with\nthe villages from which they came. Others had settled in cities\npermanently. Workers were divided by skill. A metalworker of St.\nPetersburg recalled, ëMetalworkers considered themselves aristocrats\namong other workers. Their occupations demanded more training\nand skill . . . í Women made up 31 per cent of the factory labour\nforce by 1914, but they were paid less than men (between half and\nthree-quarters of a manís wage). Divisions among workers showed\nthemselves in dress and manners too. Some workers formed\nassociations to help members in times of unemployment or financial\nhardship but such associations were few.\nDespite divisions, workers did unite to strike work (stop work) when\nthey disagreed with employers about dismissals or work conditions.\nThese strikes took place \tfrequently in the textile industry during\n1896-1897, and in the metal industry during 1902.\nIn the countryside, peasants cultivated most of the land. But the\nnobility, the crown and the Orthodox Church owned large\nproperties. Like workers, peasants too were divided. They were also\nFig.5 ñ Unemployed peasants in pre-war\nSt Petersburg.\nMany survived by eating at charitable\nkitchens and living in poorhouses.\nFig.6 ñ Workers sleeping in bunkers in a\ndormitory in pre-revolutionary Russia.\nThey slept in shifts and could not keep their\nfamilies with them.\n\n-- 42 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n32\nSource A\tdeeply religious. But except in a few cases they had no respect for the\nnobility. Nobles got their power and position through their services\nto the Tsar, not through local popularity. This was unlike France\nwhere, during the French Revolution in Brittany, peasants respected\nnobles and fought for them. In Russia, peasants wanted the land of\nthe nobles to be given to them. Frequently, they refused to pay rent\nand even murdered landlords. In 1902, this occurred on a large scale\nin south Russia. And in 1905, \tsuch incidents took place all\nover Russia.\nRussian peasants were different from other European peasants in\nanother way. They pooled their land together periodically and their\ncommune (mir) divided it according to the needs of individual families.\n2.3 Socialism in Russia\nAll political parties were illegal in Russia before 1914. The Russian\nSocial Democratic Workers Party was founded in 1898 by socialists\nwho respected Marxís ideas. However, because of government\npolicing, it had to operate as an illegal organisation. It set up a\nnewspaper, mobilised workers and organised strikes.\nSome Russian socialists felt that the Russian peasant custom of dividing\nland periodically made them natural socialists. So peasants, not\nworkers, would be the main force of the revolution, and Russia could\nbecome socialist more quickly than other countries. Socialists were\nactive in the countryside through the late nineteenth century. They\nformed the Socialist Revolutionary Party in 1900. This party struggled\nfor peasantsí rights and demanded that land belonging to nobles be\ntransferred to peasants. Social Democrats disagreed with Socialist\nRevolutionaries about peasants. Lenin felt that peasants were not\none united group. Some were poor and others rich, some worked as\nlabourers while others were capitalists who employed workers. Given\nthis ëdifferentiationí within them, they could not all be part of a\nsocialist movement.\nThe party was divided over the strategy of organisation. Vladimir\nLenin (who led the Bolshevik group) thought that in a repressive\nsociety like Tsarist Russia the party should be disciplined and should\ncontrol the number and quality of its members. Others (Mensheviks)\nthought that the party should be open to all (as in Germany).\n2.4 A Turbulent Time: The 1905 Revolution\nRussia was an autocracy. Unlike other European rulers, even at the\nbeginning of the twentieth century, the Tsar was not subject to\nAlexander Shly apnik ov, a socialist\nworker of the time, gives us a description\nof how the meetings were organised:\nëPropaganda was done in the plants and\nshops on an individual basis.

Liberals in Russia campaigned to end this state of affairs.\nTogether with the Social Democrats and Socialist Revolutionaries,\nthey worked with peasants and workers during the revolution of\n1905 to demand a constitution. They were supported in the empire\nby nationalists (in Poland for instance) and in Muslim-dominated\nareas by jadidists who wanted modernised Islam to lead their societies.\nThe year 1904 was a particularly bad one for Russian workers. Prices\nof essential goods rose so quickly that real wages declined by 20 per\ncent. The membership of workersí associations rose dramatically.\nWhen four members of the Assembly of Russian Workers, which\nhad been formed in 1904, were dismissed at the Putilov Iron Works,\nthere was a call for industrial action. Over the next few days over\n110,000 workers in St Petersburg went on strike demanding a\nreduction in the working day to eight hours, an increase in wages\nand improvement in working conditions.\nWhen the procession of workers led by Father Gapon reached the\nWinter Palace it was attacked by the police and the Cossacks. Over\n100 workers were killed and about 300 wounded. The incident,\nknown as Bloody Sunday, started a series of events that became known\nas the 1905 Revolution. Strikes took place all over the country and\nuniversities closed down when student bodies staged walkouts,\ncomplaining about the lack of civil liberties. Lawyers, doctors,\nengineers and other middle-class workers established the Union of\nUnions and demanded a constituent assembly.\nDuring the 1905 Revolution, the Tsar allowed the creation of an\nelected consultative Parliament or Duma. For a brief while during\nthe revolution, there existed a large number of trade unions and\nfactory committees made up of factory workers. After 1905, most\ncommittees and unions worked unofficially, since they were declared\nillegal. Severe restrictions were placed on political activity. The Tsar\ndismissed the first Duma within 75 days and the re-elected second\nDuma within three months. He did not want any questioning of his\nauthority or any reduction in his power. He changed the voting\nlaws and packed the third Duma with conservative politicians. Liberals\nand revolutionaries were kept out.\n2.5 The First World War and the Russian Empire\nIn 1914, war broke out between two European alliances ñ Germany,\nAustria and Turkey (the Central powers) and France, Britain and\nRussia (later Italy and Romania).

It was the\nlargest armed force in the world. When this\narmy shifted its loyalty and began supporting\nthe revolutionaries, Tsarist power collapsed.\nand the war was fought outside Europe as well as\nin Europe. This was the First World War.\nIn Russia, the war was initially popular and people\nrallied around Tsar Nicholas II. As the war\ncontinued, though, the Tsar refused to consult the\nmain parties in the Duma. Support wore thin. Anti-\nGerman sentiments ran high, as can be seen in the\nrenaming of St Petersburg ñ a German name ñ as\nPetrograd. The Tsarina Alexandraís German\norigins and poor advisers, especially a monk called\nRasputin, made the autocracy unpopular.\nThe First World War on the ëeastern frontí differed\nfrom that on the ëwestern frontí. In the west, armies\nfought from trenches stretched along eastern\nFrance. In the east, armies moved a good deal and\nfought battles leaving large casualties. Defeats were\nshocking and demoralising. Russiaís armies lost\nbadly in Germany and Austria between 1914 and\n1916. There were over 7 million casualties by 1917.\nAs they retreated, the Russian army destroyed\ncrops and buildings to prevent the enemy from\nbeing able to live off the land. The destruction of\ncrops and buildings led to over 3 million refugees in Russia. The\nsituation discredited the government and the Tsar. Soldiers did not\nwish to fight such a war.\nThe war also had a severe impact on industry. Russiaís own industries\nwere few in number and the country was cut off from other suppliers\nof industrial goods by German control of the Baltic Sea. Industrial\nequipment disintegrated more rapidly in Russia than elsewhere in\nEurope. By 1916, railway lines began to break down. Able-bodied\nmen were called up to the war. As a result, there were labour shortages\nand small workshops producing essentials were shut down. Large\nsupplies of grain were sent to feed the army. For the people in the\ncities, bread and flour became scarce. By the winter of 1916, riots at\nbread shops were common.\n\n-- 45 of 189 --\n\nSocialism in Europe and the Russian Revolution\n35\nIn the winter of 1917, conditions in the capital, Petrograd, were grim.\nThe layout of the city seemed to emphasise the divisions among its\npeople. The workersí quarters and factories were located on the right\nbank of the River Neva. On the left bank were the fashionable areas,\nthe Winter Palace, and official buildings, including the palace where\nthe Duma met. In February 1917, food shortages were deeply felt in\nthe workersí quarters. The winter was \tvery cold ñ there had been\nexceptional frost and heavy snow. Parliamentarians wishing to\npreserve elected government, were opposed to the Tsarís desire to dissolve\nthe Duma.\nOn 22 Fe bruary, a lockout took place at a\nfactory on the right bank. The next day, workers\nin fifty factories called a strike in sympathy.\nIn many factories, women led the way to strikes.\nThis came to be called the International Womenís\nDay. Demonstrating workers crossed from the\nfactory quarters to the centre of the capital ñ the\nNevskii Prospekt. At this stage, no political party\nwas actively organising the movement. As the\nfashionable quarters and official buildings were\nsurrounded by workers, the government imposed\na curfew. Demonstrators dispersed by the evening,\nbut they came back on the 24th and 25th. The\ngovernment called out the cavalry and police to\nkeep an eye on them.\nOn Sunday, 25 February, the government\nsuspended the Duma. Politicians spoke out against\nthe measure. Demonstrators returned in force to\nthe streets of the left bank on the 26th. On the\n27th, the Police Headquarters were ransacked. The\nstreets thronged with people raising slogans about\nbread, wages, better hours and democracy. The\ngovernment tried to control the situation and\ncalled out the cavalry once again. However, the\ncavalry refused to fire on the demonstrators. An\nofficer was shot at the barracks of a regiment and\nthree other regiments mutinied, voting to join the\nstriking workers. \tBy that evening, soldiers and\n3 The February Revolution in Petrograd\nFig.8 ñ The Petrograd Soviet meeting in the Duma, February 1917.\n\n-- 46 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n36\nBox 1\nActivity\nstriking workers had gathered to form a ësovietí or ëcouncilí in the\nsame building as the Duma met. This was the Petrograd Soviet.\nThe very next day, a delegation went to see the Tsar. Military\ncommanders advised him to abdicate. He followed their advice and\nabdicated on 2 March. Soviet leaders and Duma leaders formed a\nProvisional Government to run the country. Russiaís future would\nbe decided by a constituent assembly, elected on the basis of universal\nadult suffrage. Petrograd had led the February Revolution that\nbrought down the monarchy in February 1917.\nWomen in the February Revolution\n‘Women workers, often ... inspired their male co-workers … At the Lorenz telephone\nfactory, … Marfa Vasileva almost single handedly called a successful strike. Already that\nmorning, in celebration of Women’s Day, women workers had presented red bows to the\nmen … Then Marfa Vasileva, a milling machine operator stopped work and declared an\nimpromptu strike. The workers on the floor were ready to support her … The foreman\ninformed the management and sent her a loaf of bread. She took the bread but refused to\ngo back to work. The administrator asked her again why she refused to work and she\nreplied, “I cannot be the only one who is satiated when others are hungry”. Women\nworkers from another section of the factory gathered around Marfa in support and\ngradually all the other women ceased working. Soon the men downed their tools as well\nand the entire crowd rushed onto the street.’\nFrom: Choi Chatterji, Celebrating Women (2002).\n3.1 After February\nArmy officials, landowners and industrialists were influential in\nthe Provisional Government. But the liberals as well as socialists\namong them worked towards an elected government. Restrictions\non public meetings and associations were removed. ëSovietsí, like\nthe Petrograd Soviet, were set up everywhere, though no common\nsystem of election was followed.\nIn April 1917, the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin returned to\nRussia from his exile. He and the Bolsheviks had opposed the war\nsince 1914. Now he felt it was time for soviets to take over power.\nHe declared that the war be brought to a close, land be transferred\nto the peasants, and banks be nationalised. These three demands\nwere Leninís ëApril Thesesí.

But the developments of the subsequent months changed\ntheir attitude.\nThrough the summer the workersí movement spread. In industrial\nareas, factory committees were formed which began questioning\nthe way industrialists ran their factories. Trade unions grew in\nnumber. Soldiersí committees were formed in the army. In June,\nabout 500 Soviets sent representatives to an All Russian Congress\nof Soviets. As the Provisional Government saw its power reduce\nand Bolshevik influence grow, it decided to take stern measures\nagainst the spreading discontent. It resisted attempts by workers\nto \trun \tfactories \tand \tbegan \tarresting \tleaders. \tPopular\ndemonstrations staged by the Bolsheviks in July 1917 were sternly\nrepressed. Many Bolshevik leaders had to go into hiding or flee.\nMeanwhile in the countryside, peasants and their Socialist\nRevolutionary leaders pressed for a redistribution of land. Land\ncommittees were formed to handle this. Encouraged by the\nSocialist Revolutionaries, peasants seized land between July and\nSeptember 1917.\nFig.9 ñ A Bolshevik image of Lenin\naddressing workers in April 1917.\nFig.10 ñ The July Days.

In September, he began discussions for an\nuprising against the government. Bolshevik supporters in the army,\nsoviets and \tfactories were brought together.\nOn 16 October 1917, Lenin persuaded the Petrograd Soviet and\nthe Bolshevik Party to agree to a socialist seizure of power. A\nMilitary Revolutionary Committee was appointed by the Soviet\nunder Leon Trotskii to organise the seizure. The date of the event\nwas kept a secret.\nThe uprising began on 24 October. Sensing trouble, Prime Minister\nKerenskii had left the city to summon troops. At dawn, military\nmen loyal to the government seized the buildings of two Bolshevik\nnewspapers. Pro-government troops were sent to take over telephone\nand telegraph offices and protect the Winter Palace. In a swift\nresponse, the Military Revolutionary Committee ordered its\nsupporters to seize government offices and arrest ministers. Late in\nthe day, the ship Aurora shelled the Winter Palace. Other vessels\nsailed down the Neva and took over various military points. By\nnightfall, the city was under the committeeís control and the\nministers had surrendered. At a meeting of the All Russian Congress\nof Soviets in Petrograd, the majority approved the Bolshevik action.\nUprisings took place in other cities. There was heavy fighting ñ\nespecially in Moscow ñ but by December, the Bolsheviks controlled\nthe Moscow-Petrograd area.\nFig.11 ñ Lenin (left) and Trotskii (right) with\nworkers at Petrograd.\nDate of the Russian Revolution\nRussia followed the Julian calendar until\n1 February 1918.

Most\nindustry and banks were nationalised in November 1917. This meant\nthat the government took over ownership and management. Land\nwas declared social property and peasants were allowed to seize the\nland of the nobility. In cities, Bolsheviks enforced the partition of\nlarge houses according to family requirements. They banned the\nuse of the old titles of aristocracy. To assert the change, new\nuniforms were designed for the army and officials, following a\nclothing competition organised in 1918 ñ when the Soviet hat\n(budeonovka) was chosen.\nThe Bolshevik Party was renamed the Russian Communist Party\n(Bolshevik). In November 1917, the Bolsheviks conducted the\nelections to the Constituent Assembly, but they failed to gain\nmajority support. In January 1918, the Assembly rejected Bolshevik\nmeasures and Lenin dismissed the Assembly. He thought the All\nRussian Congress of Soviets was more democratic than an assembly\nelected in uncertain conditions. In March 1918, despite opposition\nby their political allies, the Bolsheviks made peace with Germany\nat Brest Litovsk. In the years that\nfollowed, the Bolsheviks became\nthe only party to participate in the\nelections \tto \tthe \tAll \tRussian\nCongress of Soviets, which became\nthe Parliament of the country.\nRussia became a one-party state.\nTrade unions were kept under\nparty control. The secret police\n(called the Cheka first, and later\nOGPU and NKVD) punished\nthose \twho \tcriticised \tthe\nBolsheviks. Many young writers\nand artists rallied to the Party\nbecause it stood for socialism and\nfor change. After October 1917,\nthis led to experiments in the arts\nand architecture. But many became\ndisillusioned \tbecause \tof \tthe\ncensorship the Party encouraged. \tFig.13 ñ May Day demonstration in Moscow in 1918.\nFig.12 ñ A soldier wearing the Soviet hat\n(budeonovka).\n\n-- 50 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n40\nBox 3\nActivity\nThe October Revolution and the Russian Countryside: Two Views\nëNews of the revolutionary uprising of October 25, 1917, reached the village the following day and\nwas greeted with enthusiasm; to the peasants it meant free land and an end to the war. ...The day\nthe news arrived, the landownerís manor house was looted, his stock farms were ìrequisitionedî\nand his vast orchard was cut down and sold to the peasants for wood; all his far buildings were\ntorn down and left in ruins while the land was distributed among the peasants who were prepared\nto live the new Soviet lifeí.\nFrom: Fedor Belov, The History of a Soviet Collective Farm\nA member of a landowning family wrote to a relative about what happened at the estate:\nëThe ìcoupî happened quite painlessly, quietly and peacefully.

Two Centuries of a Russian Village (1997).\n4.1 The Civil War\nWhen the Bolsheviks ordered land redistribution, the Russian army\nbegan to break up. Soldiers, mostly peasants, wished to go home for\nthe redistribution and deserted. Non-Bolshevik socialists, liberals and\nsupporters of autocracy condemned the Bolshevik uprising. \tTheir\nleaders moved to south Russia and organised troops to fight the\nBolsheviks (the ëredsí). During 1918 and 1919, the ëgreensí (Socialist\nRevolutionaries) and ëwhitesí (pro-Tsarists) controlled most of the\nRussian empire. They were backed by French, American, British\nand Japanese troops ñ all those forces who were worried at the growth\nof socialism in Russia. As these troops and the Bolsheviks fought a\ncivil war, looting, banditry and famine became common.\nSupporters of private property among ëwhitesí took harsh steps with\npeasants who had seized land. Such actions led to the loss of popular\nsupport for the non-Bolsheviks. By January 1920, the Bolsheviks\ncontrolled most of the former Russian empire.

In Khiva, in Central Asia, Bolshevik colonists brutally\nmassacred local nationalists in the name of defending socialism. In\nthis situation, many were confused about what the Bolshevik\ngovernment represented.\nPartly to remedy this, most non-Russian nationalities were given\npolitical autonomy in the Soviet Union (USSR) ñ the state the\nBolsheviks created from the Russian empire in December 1922.

They permitted peasants to cultivate the land that had\nbeen socialised. Bolsheviks used confiscated land to demonstrate what\ncollective work could be.\nA process of centralised planning was introduced. Officials assessed\nhow the economy could work and set targets for a five-year period.\nOn this basis they made the Five Year Plans. The government fixed\nall prices to promote industrial growth during the first two ëPlansí\n(1927-1932 and 1933-1938). Centralised planning led to economic\ngrowth. Industrial production increased (between 1929 and 1933 by\n100 per cent in the case of oil, coal and steel). New factory cities\ncame into being.\nHowever, rapid construction led to poor working conditions. In\nthe city of Magnitogorsk, the construction of a steel plant was achieved\nin three years. Workers lived hard lives and the result was 550\nstoppages of work in the first year alone. In living quarters, ëin the\nwintertime, at 40 degrees below, people had to climb down from the\nfourth floor and dash across the street in order to go to the toiletí.\nAn extended schooling system developed, and arrangements were\nmade for factory workers and peasants to enter universities. CrËches\nwere established in factories for the children of women workers.\nCheap public health care was provided. Model living quarters were\nset up for workers. The effect of all this was uneven, though, since\ngovernment resources were limited.\n\n-- 53 of 189 --\n\nSocialism in Europe and the Russian Revolution\n43\nSource C\nDreams and Realities of a Soviet Childhood in 1933\nDear grandfather Kalinin Ö\nMy family is large, there are four children.

By 1927-\n1928, the towns in Soviet Russia were facing an acute\nproblem of grain supplies. The government fixed prices\nat which grain must be sold, but the \tpeasants refused to sell their\ngrain to government buyers at these prices.\nStalin, who headed the party after the death of Lenin, introduced\nfirm emergency measures. He believed that rich peasants and traders\nin the countryside were holding stocks in the hope of higher prices.\nSpeculation had to be stopped and supplies confiscated.\nIn 1928, Party members toured the grain-producing areas, supervising\nenforced grain collections, and raiding ëkulaksí ñ the name for well-\nto-do peasants. As shortages continued, the decision was taken to\ncollectivise farms. It was argued that grain shortages were partly due\nto the small size of holdings. After 1917, land had been given over to\npeasants. These small-sized peasant farms could not be modernised.\nTo develop modern farms, and run them along industrial lines with\nmachinery, it was necessary to ëeliminate kulaksí, take away land\nfrom peasants, and establish state-controlled large farms.\nWhat followed was Stalinís collectivisation programme. From 1929,\nthe Party forced all peasants to cultivate in collective farms (kolkhoz).\nThe bulk of land and implements were transferred to the ownership\nof collective farms. Peasants worked on the land, and the kolkhoz\nprofit was shared. Enraged peasants resisted the authorities and\ndestroyed their livestock. Between 1929 and 1931, the number of\ncattle fell by one-third. Those who resisted collectivisation were\nseverely punished. Many were deported and exiled. As they resisted\ncollectivisation, peasants argued that they were not rich and they\nwere not against socialism. They merely did not want to work in\ncollective farms for a variety of reasons. Stalinís government allowed\nsome independent cultivation, but treated such cultivators\nunsympathetically.\nIn spite of collectivisation, production did not increase immediately.\nIn fact, the bad harvests of 1930-1933 led to one of most devastating\nfamines in Soviet history when over 4 million died.\nFig.18 ñ A poster during collectivisation. It\nstates: ëWe shall strike at the kulak working for\nthe decrease in cultivation.í\nFig.19 ñ Peasant women being gathered to\nwork in the large collective farms.\nNew words\nDeported ñ Forcibly removed from oneís own country.\nExiled ñ Forced to live away from oneís own country.\n\n-- 55 of 189 --\n\nSocialism in Europe and the Russian Revolution\n45\nSource E\nOfficial view of the opposition to collectivisation and the government response\nëFrom the second half of February of this year, in various regions of the Ukraine\nÖ mass insurrections of the peasantry have taken place, caused by distortions\nof the Partyís line by a section of the lower ranks of the Party and the Soviet\napparatus in the course of the introduction of collectivisation and preparatory\nwork for the spring harvest.\nWithin a short time, large scale activities from the above-mentioned regions\ncarried over into neighbouring areas ñ and the most aggressive insurrections\nha ve taken place near the border.\nThe greater part of the peasant insurrections have been linked with outright\ndemands for the return of collectivised stocks of grain, livestock and tools Ö\nBetween 1st February and 15th March, 25,000 have been arrested Ö 656 have\nbeen ex ecuted, 3673 have been imprisoned in labour camps and 5580 exiled Öí\nReport of K.M.

However, the possibility\nof a workersí state fired peopleís imagination across the world. In\nmany countries, communist parties were formed ñ like the\nCommunist Party of Great Britain. The Bolsheviks encouraged\ncolonial peoples to follow their experiment. Many non-Russians from\noutside the USSR participated in the Conference of the Peoples of\nthe East (1920) and the Bolshevik-founded Comintern (an international\nunion of pro-Bolshevik socialist parties). Some received education in\nthe USSRís Communist University of the Workers of the East. By\nthe time of the outbreak of the Second World War, the USSR had\ngiven socialism a global face and world stature.\nYet by the 1950s it was acknowledged within the country that the\nstyle of government in the USSR was not in keeping with the ideals\nof the Russian Revolution. In the world socialist movement too it\nwas recognised that all was not well in the Soviet Union. A backward\ncountry had become a great power. Its industries and agriculture\nhad developed and the poor were being fed. But it had denied the\nessential freedoms to its citizens and carried out its developmental\nprojects through repressive policies. By the end of the twentieth\ncentury, the international reputation of the USSR as a socialist\ncountry had declined though it was recognised that socialist ideals\nstill enjoyed respect among its people. But in each country the ideas\nof socialism were rethought in a variety of different ways.\n5 The Global Influence of the Russian\nRevolution and the USSR\nWriting about the Russian Revolution in India\nAmong those the Russian Revolution inspired were many Indians.

His father, a prominent physician,\ndeliberated with his wife whether the time had come to kill the entire\nfamily, or if he should commit suicide alone. His father spoke about\nhis fear of revenge, saying, ëNow the Allies will do to us what we did to\nthe crippled and Jews.í The next day, he took Helmuth to the woods,\nwhere they spent their last happy time together, singing old childrenís\nsongs. Later, Helmuthís father shot himself in his office. Helmuth\nremembers that he saw his fatherís bloody uniform being burnt in the\nfamily fireplace. So traumatised was he by what he had overheard and\nwhat had happened, that he reacted by refusing to eat at home for the\nfollowing nine years! He was afraid that his mother might poison him.\nAlthough Helmuth may not have realised all that it meant, his father\nhad been a Nazi and a supporter of Adolf Hitler. Many of you will\nknow something about the Nazis and Hitler. You probably know\nof Hitlerís determination to make Germany into a mighty power\nand his ambition of conquering all of Europe. You may have heard\nthat he killed Jews. But Nazism was not one or two isolated acts. It\nwas a system, a structure of ideas about the world and politics. Let\nus try and understand what Nazism was all about. Let us see why\nHelmuthís father killed himself and what the basis of his fear was.\nIn May 1945, Germany surrendered to the Allies. Anticipating what\nwas coming, Hitler, his propaganda minister Goebbels and his entire\nfamily committed suicide collectively in his Berlin bunker in April.\nAt the end of the war, an International Military Tribunal at\nNuremberg was set up to prosecute Nazi war criminals for Crimes\nagainst Peace, for War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity.\nGermanyís conduct during the war, especially those actions which\nNazism \tand \tthe \tRise\tNazism \tand \tthe \tRise\tNazism \tand \tthe \tRise\tNazism \tand \tthe \tRise\tNazism \tand \tthe \tRise\nof Hitler\tof Hitler\tof Hitler\tof Hitler\tof Hitler\nNazism\n \nand\n \nthe\n \nRise\n \nof Hitler\nFig.1 ñ Hitler (centre) and Goebbels (left)\nleaving after an official meeting, 1932.\nNew words\nAllies ñ The Allied Powers were initially led by the UK and France.\nIn 1941 they were joined by the USSR and USA.

What\nwere these acts?\nUnder the shadow of the Second World War, Germany had waged\na genocidal war, which resulted in the mass murder of selected\ngroups of innocent civilians of Europe. The number of people killed\nincluded 6 million Jews, 200,000 Gypsies, 1 million Polish civilians,\n70,000 Germans who were considered mentally and physically\ndisabled, besides innumerable political opponents. Nazis devised\nan unprecedented means of killing people, that is, by gassing them in\nvarious killing centres like Auschwitz. The Nuremberg Tribunal\nsentenced only eleven leading Nazis to death. Many others were\nimprisoned for life. The retribution did come, yet the punishment\nof the Nazis was far short of the brutality and extent of their crimes.\nThe Allies did not want to be as harsh on defeated Germany as\nthey had been after the First World War.\nEveryone came to feel that the rise of Nazi Germany could be\npartly traced back to the German experience at the end of \tthe\nFirst World War.\nWhat was this experinece?\nNew words\nGenocidal ñ Killing on large scale leading\nto destruction of large sections of people\n\n-- 61 of 189 --\n\nNazism and the Rise of Hitler\n51\nGermany, a powerful empire in the early years of the twentieth\ncentury, \tfought the First World War (1914-1918) alongside the\nAustrian empire and against the Allies (England, France and Russia.)\nAll joined the war enthusiastically hoping to gain from a quick\nvictory.

From a continent of creditors,\nEurope turned into one of debtors. Unfortunately, the infant Weimar\nRepublic was being made to pay for the sins of the old empire. The\nrepublic carried the burden of war guilt and national humiliation\nand was financially crippled by being forced to pay compensation.\nThose who supported the Weimar Republic, mainly Socialists, Catholics\nand Democrats, became easy targets of attack in the conservative\nnationalist circles. They were mockingly called the ëNovember criminalsí.\nThis mindset had a major impact on the political developments of the\nearly 1930s, as we will soon see.\nThe First World War left a deep imprint on European society and\npolity. Soldiers came to be placed above civilians. Politicians and\npublicists laid great stress on the need for men to be aggressive, strong\nand masculine. The media glorified trench life. The truth, however,\nwas that soldiers lived miserable lives in these trenches, trapped with\nrats feeding on corpses. They faced poisonous gas and enemy shelling,\nand witnessed their ranks reduce rapidly. Aggressive war propaganda\nand national honour occupied centre stage in the public sphere, while\npopular support grew for conservative dictatorships that had recently\ncome into being. Democracy was indeed a young and fragile idea,\nwhich could not survive the instabilities of interwar Europe.\n1.2 Political Radicalism and Economic Crises\nThe birth of the Weimar Republic coincided with the revolutionary\nuprising of the Spartacist League on the pattern of the Bolshevik\nRevolution in Russia. Soviets of workers and sailors were established\nVersailles with the Allies was a harsh and humiliating peace. Germany lost\nits overseas colonies, a tenth of its population, 13 per cent of its territories,\n75 per cent of its iron and 26 per cent of its coal to France, Poland,\nDenmark and Lithuania. The Allied Powers demilitarised Germany to\nweaken its power. The War Guilt Clause held Germany responsible for\nthe war and damages the Allied countries suffered. Germany was forced\nto pay compensation amounting to £6 billion. The Allied armies also\noccupied the resource-rich Rhineland for much of the 1920s. Many\nGermans held the new Weimar Republic responsible for not only the\ndefeat in the war but the disgrace at Versailles.\n\n-- 63 of 189 --\n\nNazism and the Rise of Hitler\n53\nin many cities. The political atmosphere in Berlin was charged with\ndemands for Soviet-style governance. Those opposed to this ñ such\nas the socialists, Democrats and Catholics ñ met in Weimar to give\nshape to the democratic republic. The Weimar Republic crushed the\nuprising with the help of a war veterans organisation called Free\nCorps. The anguished Spartacists later founded the Communist Party of\nGermany. Communists and Socialists henceforth became irreconcilable\nenemies and could not make common cause against Hitler. Both\nrevolutionaries and militant nationalists craved for radical solutions.\nPolitical radicalisation was only heightened by the economic crisis\nof 1923. Germany had fought the war largely on loans and had to\npay war reparations in gold. This depleted gold reserves at a time\nresources were scarce. In 1923 Germany refused to pay, and the\nFrench occupied its leading industrial area, Ruhr, to claim their coal.\nGermany retaliated with passive resistance and printed paper currency\nrecklessly. With too much \tprinted money in circulation, the value\nof the German mark fell. In April the US dollar was equal to 24,000\nmarks, in July 353,000 marks, in August 4,621,000 marks \tand \tat\nFig.3 ñ This is a rally organised by the radical group known as the Spartacist League.\nIn the winter of 1918-1919 the streets of Berlin were taken over by the people. Political demonstrations became common.\nFig.4 ñ Baskets and carts being loaded at a\nbank in Berlin with paper currency for wage\npayment, 1923. The German mark had so\nlittle value that vast amounts had to be used\neven for small payments.\nNew words\nDeplete ñ Reduce, empty out\nReparation ñ Make up for a wrong done\n\n-- 64 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n54\n98,860,000 marks by December, the figure had run into trillions. As\nthe value of the mark collapsed, prices of goods soared. The image of\nGermans carrying cartloads of currency notes to buy a loaf of bread\nwas widely publicised evoking worldwide sympathy. This crisis came\nto be known as hyperinflation, a situation when prices rise\nphenomenally high.\nEventually, the Americans intervened and bailed Germany out of\nthe crisis by introducing the Dawes Plan, which reworked the terms\nof reparation to ease the financial burden on Germans.\n1.3 The Years of Depression\nThe years between 1924 and 1928 saw some stability. Yet this was\nbuilt on sand. German investments and industrial recovery were\ntotally dependent on short-term loans, largely from the USA. This\nsupport was withdrawn when the Wall Street Exchange crashed in\n1929. Fearing a fall in prices, people made frantic efforts to sell their\nshares. On one single day, 24 October, 13 million shares were sold.\nThis was the start of the Great Economic Depression. Over the next\nthree years, between 1929 and 1932, the national income of the USA\nfell by half. Factories shut down, exports fell, farmers were badly hit\nand speculators withdrew their money from the market. The effects\nof this recession in the US economy were felt worldwide.\nThe German economy was the worst hit by the economic crisis. By\n1932, industrial production was reduced to 40 per cent of the 1929\nlevel. Workers lost their jobs or were paid reduced wages. The number\nof unemployed touched an unprecedented 6 million. On the streets\nof Germany you could see men with placards around their necks\nsaying, ëWilling to do any workí. Unemployed youths played cards\nor simply sat at street corners, or desperately queued up at the local\nemployment exchange. As jobs disappeared, the youth took to\ncriminal activities and total despair became commonplace.\nThe economic crisis created deep anxieties and fears in people. The\nmiddle classes, especially salaried employees and pensioners, saw\ntheir savings diminish when the currency lost its value. Small\nbusinessmen, the self-employed and retailers suffered as their\nFig.5 ñ Homeless men queuing up for a\nnightís shelter, 1923.\nFig.6 ñ Sleeping on the line.

These sections of society were filled with the\nfear of proletarianisation, an anxiety of being reduced to the ranks\nof the working class, or worse still, the unemployed. Only organised\nworkers could manage to keep their heads above water, but\nunemployment weakened their bargaining power. Big business was\nin crisis. The large mass of peasantry was affected by a sharp fall in\nagricultural prices and women, unable to fill their childrenís\nstomachs, were filled with a sense of deep despair.\nPolitically too the Weimar Republic was fragile. The Weimar\nconstitution had some inherent defects, which made it unstable\nand \tvulnerable \tto \tdictatorship. \tOne \twas \tproportional\nrepresentation. This made achieving a majority by any one party a\nnear impossible task, leading to a rule by coalitions. Another defect\nwas Article 48, which gave the President the powers to impose\nemergency, suspend civil rights and rule by decree. Within its short\nlife, the Weimar Republic saw twenty different cabinets lasting on\nan average 239 days, and a liberal use of Article 48. Yet the crisis\ncould not be managed. People lost confidence in the democratic\nparliamentary system, which seemed to offer no solutions.\nNew words\nProletarianisation ñ To become impoverished to the level of\nworking classes.\n\n-- 66 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n56\nThis crisis in the economy, polity and society formed the background\nto Hitlerís rise to power. Born in 1889 in Austria, Hitler spent his\nyouth in poverty. When the First World War broke out, he enrolled\nfor the army, acted as a messenger in the front, became a corporal, and\nearned medals for bravery. The German defeat horrified him and the\nVersailles Treaty made him furious. In 1919, he joined a small group\ncalled the German Workersí Party. He subsequently took over the\norganisation and renamed it the National Socialist German Workersí\nParty. This party came to be known as the Nazi Party.\nIn 1923, Hitler planned to seize control of Bavaria, march to Berlin\nand capture power. He failed, was arrested, tried for treason, and\nlater released. The Nazis could not effectively mobilise popular\nsupport till the early 1930s. It was during the Great Depression that\nNazism became a mass movement. As we have seen, after 1929, banks\ncollapsed and businesses shut down, workers lost their jobs and the\nmiddle classes were threatened with destitution. In such a situation\nNazi propaganda stirred hopes of a better future. In 1928, the Nazi\nParty got no more than 2. 6 per cent votes in the Reichstag ñ the\nGerman parliament. By 1932, it had become the largest party with\n37 per cent votes.\n2 Hitler’s Rise to Power\nFig.7 ñ Hitler being greeted at the Party Congress in Nuremberg in 1938.\nNew words\nPropaganda ñ Specific type of message\ndirectly aimed at influencing the opinion\nof people (through the use of posters, films,\nspeeches, etc.)\n\n-- 67 of 189 --\n\nNazism and the Rise of Hitler\n57\nHitler was a powerful speaker. His passion and his words moved\npeople. He promised to build a strong nation, undo the injustice of\nthe Versailles Treaty and restore the dignity of the German people.\nHe promised employment for those looking for work, and a secure\nfuture for the youth. He promised to weed out all foreign influences\nand resist all foreign ëconspiraciesí against Germany.\nHitler devised a new style of politics. He understood the significance\nof rituals and spectacle in mass mobilisation. Nazis held massive rallies\nand public meetings to demonstrate the support for Hitler and instil\na sense of unity among the people. The Red banners with the\nSwastika, the Nazi salute, and the ritualised rounds of applause after\nthe speeches were all part of this spectacle of power.\nFig.9 ó Hitler addressing SA and SS columns.\nNotice the sweeping and straight columns of\npeople. Such photographs were intended to\nshow the grandeur and power of the Nazi\nmovement\nFig.8 ñ Nuremberg Rally, 1936.\nRallies like this were held every year. An\nimportant aspect of these was the\ndemonstration of Nazi power as various\norganisations paraded past Hitler, swore\nloyalty and listened to his speeches.\n\n-- 68 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n58\nNazi propaganda skilfully projected Hitler as a messiah, a saviour, as\nsomeone who had arrived to deliver people from their distress. It is\nan image that captured the imagination of a people whose sense of\ndignity and pride had been shattered, and who were living in a time\nof acute economic and political crises.\n2.1 The Destruction of Democracy\nOn 30 January 1933, President Hindenburg offered the\nChancellorship, the highest position in the cabinet of ministers, to\nHitler. By now the Nazis had managed to rally the conservatives to\ntheir cause. Having acquired power, Hitler set out to dismantle the\nstructures of democratic rule. A mysterious fire that broke out in\nthe German Parliament building in February facilitated his move.\nThe Fire Decree of 28 February 1933 indefinitely suspended civic\nrights like freedom of speech, press and assembly that had been\nguaranteed by the Weimar constitution. Then he turned on his arch-\nenemies, the Communists, most of whom were hurriedly packed off\nto the newly established concentration camps. The repression of\nthe Communists was severe. Out of the surviving 6,808 arrest files\nof Duesseldorf, a small city of half a million population, 1,440 were\nthose of Communists alone. They were, however, only one among\nthe 52 types of victims persecuted by the Nazis across the country.\nOn 3 March 1933, the famous Enabling Act was passed. This Act\nestablished dictatorship in Germany. It gave Hitler all powers to\nsideline Parliament and rule by decree. All political parties and trade\nunions were banned except for the Nazi Party and its affiliates. The\nstate established complete control over the economy, media, army\nand judiciary.\nSpecial surveillance and security forces were created to control and\norder society in ways that the Nazis wanted. Apart from the already\nexisting regular police in green uniform and the SA or the Storm\nTroopers, these included the Gestapo (secret state police), the SS (the\nprotection squads), criminal police and the Security Service (SD). It\nwas the extra-constitutional powers of these newly organised forces\nthat gave the Nazi state its reputation as the most dreaded criminal\nstate. People could now be detained in Gestapo torture chambers,\nrounded up and sent to concentration camps, deported at will or\narrested without any legal procedures. The police forces acquired\npowers to rule with impunity.\nNew words\nConcentration camp ñ A camp where people\nwere isolated and detained without due\nprocess of law. Typically, it was surrounded\nby electrified barbed wire fences.\n\n-- 69 of 189 --\n\nNazism and the Rise of Hitler\n59\n2.2 Reconstruction\nHitler assigned the responsibility of economic recovery to the\neconomist Hjalmar Schacht who aimed at full production and full\nemployment through a state-funded work-creation programme. This\nproject produced the famous German superhighways and the\npeopleís car, the Volkswagen.\nIn foreign policy also Hitler acquired quick successes. He pulled\nout of the League of Nations in 1933, reoccupied the Rhineland in\n1936, and integrated Austria and Germany in 1938 under the slogan,\nOne people, One empire, and One leader. He then went on to wrest German-\nspeaking Sudentenland from Czechoslovakia, and gobbled up the\nentire country. In all of this he had the unspoken support of\nEngland, which had considered the Versailles verdict too harsh.\nThese quick successes at home and abroad seemed to reverse the\ndestiny of the country.\nHitler did not stop here. Schacht had advised Hitler against investing\nhugely in rearmament as the state still ran on deficit financing.\nCautious people, however, had no place in Nazi Germany. Schacht\nhad to leave. Hitler chose war as the way out of the approaching\nFig.10 ñ The poster announces: ëYour\nvolkswagení.\nSuch posters suggested that owning a car was\nno longer just a dream for an ordinary worker.\nFig.11 ñ Expansion of Nazi power: Europe 1942.\n\n-- 70 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n60\neconomic crisis. Resources were to be accumulated through\nexpansion of territory. \tIn September 1939, Germany invaded\nPoland. This started a war with France and England. In September\n1940, a Tripartite Pact was signed between Germany, Italy and\nJapan, strengthening Hitlerís claim to international power. Puppet\nregimes, supportive of Nazi Germany, were installed in a large\npart of Europe. By the end of 1940, Hitler was at the pinnacle of\nhis power.\nHitler now moved to achieve his long-term aim of conquering\nEastern Europe. He wanted to ensure food supplies and living space\nfor Germans. He attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941. In this\nhistoric blunder Hitler exposed the German western front to British\naerial bombing and the eastern front to the powerful Soviet armies.\nThe Soviet Red Army inflicted a crushing and humiliating defeat\non Germany at Stalingrad. \tAfter this the Soviet Red Army\nhounded out the retreating German soldiers until they reached the\nheart of Berlin, establishing Soviet hegemony over the entire Eastern\nEurope for half a century thereafter.\nMeanwhile, the USA had resisted involvement in the war. It was\nunwilling to once again face all the economic problems that the\nFirst World War had caused. But it could not stay out of the war\nfor long. Japan was expanding its power in the east. It had occupied\nFrench Indo-China and was planning attacks on US naval bases in\nthe Pacific. When Japan extended its support to Hitler and bombed\nthe US base at Pearl Harbor, the US entered the Second World\nWar. The war ended in May 1945 with Hitlerís defeat and the US\ndropping of the atom bomb on Hiroshima in Japan.\nFrom this brief account of what happened in the Second World\nWar, we now return to Helmuth and his fatherís story, a story of\nNazi criminality during the war.\nFig.12 ñ Newspapers in India track the\ndevelopments in Germany.\n\n-- 71 of 189 --\n\nNazism and the Rise of Hitler\n61\nActivity\nThe crimes that Nazis committed were linked to a system of belief\nand a set of practices.\nNazi ideology was synonymous with Hitlerís worldview. According\nto this there was no equality between people, but only a racial\nhierarchy. In this view blond, blue-eyed, Nordic German Aryans\nwere at the top, while Jews were located at the lowest rung. They\ncame to be regarded as an anti-race, the arch-enemies of the Aryans.\nAll other coloured people were placed in between depending upon\ntheir external features. Hitlerís racism borrowed from thinkers like\nCharles Darwin and Herbert Spencer. Darwin was a natural scientist\nwho tried to explain the creation of plants and animals through the\nconcept of evolution and natural selection. Herbert Spencer later\nadded the idea of survival of the fittest. According to this idea, only\nthose species survived on earth that could adapt themselves to\nchanging climatic conditions. We should bear in mind that Darwin\nnever advocated human intervention in what he thought was a purely\nnatural process of selection. However, his ideas were used by racist\nthinkers and politicians to justify imperial rule over conquered\npeoples. The Nazi argument was simple: the strongest race would\nsurvive and the weak ones would perish. The Aryan race was the\nfinest. It had to retain its purity, become stronger and dominate the\nworld.\nThe other aspect of Hitlerís ideology related to the geopolitical\nconcept of Lebensraum, or living space. He believed that new territories\nhad to be acquired for settlement. This would enhance the area of\nthe mother country, while enabling the settlers on new lands to retain\nan intimate link with the place of their origin. It would also enhance\nthe material resources and power of the German nation.\nHitler intended to extend German boundaries by moving eastwards,\nto concentrate all Germans geographically in one place. Poland became\nthe laboratory for this experimentation.\n3.1 Establishment of the Racial State\nOnce in power, the Nazis quickly began to implement their dream\nof creating an exclusive racial community of pure Germans by\nphysically eliminating all those who were seen as ëundesirableí in the\n3 The Nazi Worldview\nSource A\nëFor this earth is not allotted to anyone\nnor is it presented to anyone as a gift.

Nazis wanted only a society of ëpure and healthy\nNordic Aryansí. They alone were considered ëdesirableí. Only they\nwere seen as worthy of prospering and multiplying against all others\nwho were classed as ëundesirableí. This meant that even those Germans\nwho were seen as impure or abnormal had no right to exist. Under\nthe Euthanasia Programme, Helmuthís father along with other Nazi\nofficials had condemned to death many Germans who were considered\nmentally or physically unfit.\nJews were not the only community classified as ëundesirableí. There\nwere others. Many Gypsies and blacks living in Nazi Germany were\nconsidered as racial ëinferiorsí who threatened the biological purity\nof the ësuperior Aryaní race. They were widely persecuted. Even\nRussians and Poles were considered subhuman, and hence undeserving\nof any humanity. When Germany occupied Poland and parts of\nRussia, captured civilians were forced to work as slave labour. Many\nof them died simply through hard work and starvation.\nJews remained the worst sufferers in Nazi Germany. Nazi hatred of\nJews had a precursor in the traditional Christian hostility towards\nJews. They had been stereotyped as killers of Christ and\nusurers.Until medieval times \tJews were barred from owning land.\nThey survived mainly through trade and moneylending. They lived\nin separately marked areas called ghettos. They were often persecuted\nthrough periodic organised violence, and expulsion from the land.\nHowever, Hitlerís hatred of Jews was based on pseudoscientific\ntheories of race, which held that conversion was no solution to\nëthe Jewish problemí. It could be solved only through their\ntotal elimination.\nFrom 1933 to 1938 the Nazis terrorised, pauperised and segregated\nthe Jews, compelling them to leave the country. The next phase,\n1939-1945, aimed at concentrating them in certain areas and eventually\nkilling them in gas chambers in Poland.\n3.2 The Racial Utopia\nUnder the shadow of war, the Nazis proceeded to realise their\nmurderous, racial ideal. Genocide and war became two sides of the\nsame coin. Occupied Poland was divided up. Much of north-western\nPoland was annexed to Germany. Poles were forced to leave their\nhomes and properties behind to be occupied by ethnic Germans\nbrought in from occupied Europe. Poles were then herded like\nNew words\nGypsy ñ The groups that were classified as\nëgypsyí had their own community identity.\nSinti and Roma were two such communities.\nMany of them traced their origin to India.\nPauperised ñ Reduce to absolute poverty\nPersecution \tñ \tSystematic, \torganised\npunishment of those belonging to a group\nor religion\nUsurers ñ Moneylenders charging excessive\ninterest; often used as a term of abuse\nFig.13 ñ Police escorting gypsies who are\nbeing deported to Auschwitz, 1943-1944.\n\n-- 73 of 189 --\n\nNazism and the Rise of Hitler\n63\nActivity\nSee the next two pages and write briefly:\n!

This identity mark was stamped on their passport,\nall legal documents and houses. They were kept in Jewish houses in Germany, and in ghettos like Lodz and Warsaw in the east. These\nbecame sites of extreme misery and poverty. Jews had to surrender all their wealth before they entered a ghetto. Soon the ghettos\nwere brimming with hunger, starvation and disease due to deprivation and poor hygiene.\nFig.15 ñ The sign declares that\nthis North Sea bathing resort is\nfree of Jews.\nFig.16 ñ Park bench announces: ëFOR ARYANS ONLYí\nFig.17 ñ ëThis is all I have to sellí.\nMen and women were left with nothing to survive\nin the ghettos.\nNew words\nSynagogues ñ Place of worship for people\nof Jewish faith\nStage 1: Exclusion 1933-1939\nYOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO LIVE AMONG US AS CITIZENS\nThe Nuremberg Laws of citizenship of September 1935:\n1.

He felt\nthat a strong Nazi society could be established only by teaching children\nNazi ideology. This required a control over the child both inside and\noutside school.\nWhat happened in schools under Nazism? All schools were ëcleansedí\nand ëpurifiedí. This meant that teachers who were Jews or seen as\nëpolitically unreliableí were dismissed. Children were first segregated:\nGermans and Jews could not sit together or play together.\nSubsequently, ëundesirable childrení ñ Jews, the physically handicapped,\nGypsies ñ were thrown out of schools. And finally in the 1940s, they\nwere taken to the gas chambers.\nëGood Germaní children were subjected to a process of Nazi schooling,\na prolonged period of ideological training. School textbooks were\nrewritten. Racial science was introduced to justify Nazi ideas of race.\nStereotypes about Jews were popularised even through maths classes.\nChildren were taught to be loyal and submissive, hate Jews, and worship\nHitler. Even the function of sports was to nurture a spirit of violence\nand aggression among children. Hitler believed that boxing could make\nchildren iron hearted, strong and masculine.\nYouth organisations were made responsible for educating German\nyouth in the ëthe spirit of National Socialismí. Ten-year-olds had to\nenter Jungvolk. At 14, all boys had to join the Nazi youth organisation\nñ Hitler Youth ñ where they learnt to worship war, glorify aggression\nand violence, condemn democracy, and hate Jews, communists, Gypsies\nand all those categorised as ëundesirableí. After a period of rigorous\nideological and physical training they joined the Labour Service, usually\nat the age of 18. Then they had to serve in the armed forces and enter\none of the Nazi organisations.\nThe Youth League of the Nazis was founded in 1922. Four years later\nit was renamed Hitler Youth. To unify the youth movement under\nNazi control, all other youth organisations were systematically dissolved\nand finally banned.\n4 Youth in Nazi Germany\nIf you were a student sitting in one of these\nclasses, how would you have felt towards\nJews?\nHave you ever thought of the stereotypes of\nother communities that people around you\nbelieve in?

To encourage women to produce many children, Honour\nCrosses were awarded.

Many received jail sentences and lost\ncivic honour as well as their husbands and families for this\nëcriminal offenceí.\n4.2. The Art of Propaganda\nThe Nazi regime used language and media with care, and often to\ngreat effect. The terms they coined to describe their various\npractices are not only deceptive. They are chilling. Nazis never\nused the words ëkillí or ëmurderí in their official communications.\nMass killings were termed special treatment, final solution (for the Jews),\neuthanasia (for the disabled), selection and disinfections. ëEvacuationí\nmeant deporting people to gas chambers. Do you know what the\ngas chambers were called? They were labelled ëdisinfection-areasí,\nand looked like bathrooms equipped with fake showerheads.\nMedia was carefully used to win support for the regime and\npopularise its worldview. Nazi ideas were spread through visual\nimages, films, radio, posters, catchy slogans and leaflets. In posters,\ngroups identified as the ëenemiesí of Germans were stereotyped,\nmocked, abused and described as evil. Socialists and liberals were\nrepresented as weak and degenerate. They were attacked as\nmalicious foreign agents. Propaganda films were made to create\nhatred for Je ws. The most infamous film was The Eternal Jew.\nOrthodox Jews were stereotyped and marked.

They felt hatred and anger surge inside them when\nthey saw someone who looked like a Jew. They marked the houses\nof Jews and reported suspicious neighbours. They genuinely believed\nNazism would bring prosperity \tand improve general well-being.\nBut not every German was a Nazi. Many organised active resistance\nto Nazism, braving police repression and death. The large majority\nof Germans, however, were passive onlookers and apathetic witnesses.\nThey were too scared to act, to differ, to protest. They preferred to\nlook \taway. Pastor Niemoeller, a resistance fighter, observed an\nabsence of protest, an uncanny silence, amongst ordinary Germans\nin the face of brutal and organised crimes committed against people\nin the Nazi empire. He wrote movingly about this silence:\n‘First they came for the Communists,\nWell, I was not a Communist ñ\nSo I said nothing.\nThen they came for the Social Democrats,\nWell, I was not a Social Democrat\nSo I did nothing,\nThen they came for the trade unionists,\nBut I was not a trade unionist.\nAnd then they came for the Jews,\nBut I was not a Jew ñ so I did little.\nThen when they came for me,\nThere was no one left who could stand up for me.’\nWas the lack of concern for Nazi victims only\nbecause of the Terror? No, says Lawrence\nRees who interviewed people from diverse\nbackgrounds for his recent documentary,\nëThe Nazis: A Warning from Historyí.\nErna Kranz, an ordinary German teenager in\nthe1930s and a grandmother now, said to\nRees:\në1930s offered a glimmer of hope, not just for\nthe unemployed but for everybody for we all\nfelt downtrodden.

How do you\nview her opinion?\n\n-- 82 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n72\nWhat Jews felt in Nazi Germany is a different story altogether.\nCharlotte Beradt secretly recorded peopleís dreams in her diary and\nlater published them in a highly disconcerting book called the Third\nReich of Dreams. She describes how Jews themselves began believing in\nthe Nazi stereotypes about them. They dreamt of their hooked noses,\nblack hair and eyes, Jewish looks and body movements. The\nstereotypical images publicised in the Nazi press haunted the Jews.\nThey troubled them even in their dreams. Jews died many deaths\neven before they reached the gas chamber.\n5.1 Knowledge about the Holocaust\nInformation about Nazi practices had trickled out of Germany\nduring the last years of the regime. But it was only after the war\nended and Germany was defeated that the world came to realise the\nhorrors of what had happened. While the Germans were preoccupied\nwith their own plight as a defeated nation emerging out of the rubble,\nthe Jews wanted the world to remember the atrocities and sufferings\nthey had endured during the Nazi killing operations ñ also called the\nHolocaust. At its height, a ghetto inhabitant had said to another that\nhe wanted to outlive the war just for half an hour. Presumably he\nmeant that he wanted to be able to tell the world about what had\nhappened in Nazi Germany. This indomitable spirit to bear witness\nand to preserve the documents can be seen in many ghetto and camp\ninhabitants who wrote diaries, kept notebooks, and created archives.\nOn the other hand when the war seemed lost, the Nazi leadership\ndistributed petrol to its functionaries to destroy all incriminating\nevidence available in offices.\nYet the history and the memory of the Holocaust live on in memoirs,\nfiction, documentaries, poetry, memorials and museums in many\nparts of the world today. These are a tribute to those who resisted it,\nan embarrassing reminder to those who collaborated, and a warning\nto those who watched in silence.\nFig.31 ñ Inhabitants of the Warsaw ghetto\ncollected documents and placed them in three\nmilk cans along with other containers.

We\nwill look at how the lives of forest dwellers, pastoralists and peasants changed in the\nmodern world and how they played a part in shaping these changes.\nAll too often in looking at the emergence of the modern world, we only focus on\nfactories and cities, on the industrial and agricultural sectors which supply the market.\nBut we forget that there are other economies outside these sectors, other people too\nwho matter to the nation. To modern eyes, the lives of pastoralists and forest dwellers,\nthe shifting cultivators and food gatherers often seem to be stuck in the past. It is as\nif their lives are not important when we study the emergence of the contemporary\nworld. The chapters in Section II will suggest that we need to know about their\nlives, see how they organise their world and operate their economies. These\ncommunities are very much part of the modern world we live in today. They are\nnot simply survivors from a bygone era.\nChapter IV will take you into the forest and tell you about the variety of ways the\nforests were used by communities living within them. It will show how in the\nnineteenth century the growth of industries and urban centres, \tships and railways,\ncreated a new demand on the forests for timber and other forest products. New\ndemands led to new rules of forest use, new ways of organising the forest. You will\nsee how colonial control was established over the forests, how forest areas were\nmapped, trees were classified, and plantations were developed. All these developments\naffected the lives of those local communities who used forest resources. They were\nforced to operate within new systems and reorganise their lives. But they also rebelled\nagainst the rules and persuaded the state to change its policies. The chapter will give\nyou an idea of the history of such developments in India and Indonesia.\nSECTION \tII\nLIVELIHOODS, ECONOMIES AND SOCIETIES\nLIVELIHOODS, ECONOMIES AND SOCIETIES\n\n-- 86 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n76\nChapter V will track the movements of the pastoralists in the mountains and deserts,\nin the plains and plateaus of India and Africa. Pastoral communities in both these\nareas form an important segment of the population. Yet we rarely study their lives.\nTheir histories do not enter the pages of textbooks. \tChapter V will show how their\nlives were affected by the controls established over the forest, the expansion of agri-\nculture, and the decline of grazing fields. It will tell you about the patterns of their\nmovements, their relationships to other communities, and the way they adjust to\nchanging situations.\nIn Chapter VI we will read about the changes in the lives of peasants and farmers. We\nwill discuss the developments in India, England and the USA. Over the last two\ncenturies there have been major changes in the way agriculture is organised. New\ntechnology and new demands, new rules and laws, new ideas of property have\nradically changed the rural world. The growth of capitalism and colonialism have\naltered rural lives. Chapter VI will introduce you to these changes, and show how\ndifferent groups of people ñ the poor and rich, men and women, adults and children\nñ were affected in different ways.\nWe cannot understand the making of the contemporary world unless we begin to see\nthe changes in the lives of diverse communities and people. We also cannot understand\nthe problems of modernisation unless we look at its impact on the environment.\n\n-- 87 of 189 --\n\nForest Society and Colonialism\n77\nTake a quick look around your school and home and identify all\nthe things that come from forests: the paper in the book you are\nreading, desks and tables, doors and windows, the dyes that colour\nyour clothes, spices in your food, the cellophane wrapper of your\ntoffee, tendu leaf in bidis, gum, honey, coffee, tea and rubber. Do\nnot miss out the oil in chocolates, which comes from sal seeds, the\ntannin used to convert skins and hides into leather, or the herbs\nand roots used for medicinal purposes. Forests also provide bamboo,\nwood for fuel, grass, charcoal, packaging, fruits, flowers, animals,\nbirds and many other things. In the Amazon forests or in the\nWestern Ghats, it is possible to find as many as 500 different plant\nspecies in one forest patch.\nA lot of this diversity is fast disappearing. Between 1700 and 1995,\nthe period of industrialisation, 13.9 million sq km of forest or 9.3\nper cent of the worldís total area was cleared for industrial uses,\ncultivation, pastures and fuelwood.\nForest Society and Colonialism\nForest Society and\tForest Society and\tForest Society and\tForest Society and\tForest Society and\nColonialism\tColonialism\tColonialism\tColonialism\tColonialism\nFig.1 ñ A sal forest in Chhattisgarh.\nLook at the different heights of the trees and plants in this\npicture, and the variety of species.

The process began many\ncenturies ago; but under colonial rule it became more systematic and\nextensive. Let us look at some of the causes of deforestation in India.\n1.1 Land to be Improved\nIn 1600, approximately one-sixth of Indiaís landmass was under\ncultivation. Now that figure has gone up to about half. As population\nincreased over the centuries and the demand for food went up,\npeasants extended the boundaries of cultivation, clearing forests and\nbreaking new land. In the colonial period, cultivation expanded\nrapidly for a variety of reasons. First, the British directly encouraged\n1 Why Deforestation?\nFig.2 ñ When the valleys were full. Painting by John Dawson.\nNative Americans like the Lakota tribe who lived in the Great North American Plains had a diversified economy. They\ncultivated maize, foraged for wild plants and hunted bison. Keeping vast areas open for the bison to range in was seen by\nthe English settlers as wasteful. After the 1860s the bisons were killed in large numbers.\n\n-- 89 of 189 --\n\nForest Society and Colonialism\n79\nSource A\nThe idea that uncultivated land had to\nbe taken over and improved was popular\nwith colonisers everywhere in the world.\nIt was an argument that justified\nconquest.\nIn 1896 the American writer, Richard\nHarding, wrote on the Honduras in\nCentral America:\nëThere is no more interesting question of\nthe present day than that of what is to\nbe done with the worldís land which is\nlying unimproved; whether it shall go to\nthe great power that is willing to turn it\nto account, or remain with its original\nowner, who fails to understand its value.\nThe Central Americans are like a gang of\nsemi-barbarians in a beautifully furnished\nhouse, of which they can understand\nneither its possibilities of comfort nor its\nuse.í\nThree years later the American-owned\nUnited Fruit Company was founded, and\ngrew bananas on an industrial scale in\nCentral America. \tThe company acquired\nsuch power over the governments of\nthese countries that they came to be\nknown as Banana Republics.\nQuoted in David Spurr, The Rhetoric of\nEmpire, (1993).\nthe production of commercial crops like jute, sugar, wheat and\ncotton. The demand for these crops increased in nineteenth-century\nEurope where foodgrains were needed to feed the growing urban\npopulation and raw materials were required for industrial\nproduction. Second, \tin the early nineteenth century, the colonial\nstate thought that forests were unproductive. They were considered\nto be wilderness that had to be brought under cultivation so that\nthe land could yield agricultural products and revenue, and enhance\nthe income of the state. So between 1880 and 1920, cultivated area\nrose by 6.7 million hectares.\nWe always see the expansion of cultivation as a sign of progress.\nBut we should not forget that for land to be brought under the\nplough, forests have to be cleared.\n1.2 Sleepers on the Tracks\nBox 1\nThe absence of cultivation in a place does not mean the land was\nuninhabited. In Australia, when the white settlers landed, they\nclaimed that the continent was empty or terra nullius. In fact, they\nwere guided through the landscape by aboriginal tracks, and led\nby aboriginal guides. The different aboriginal communities in\nAustralia had clearly demarcated territories. The Ngarrindjeri\npeople of Australia plotted their land along the symbolic body of\nthe first ancestor, Ngurunderi. This land included five different\nenvironments: salt water, riverine tracts, lakes, bush and desert\nplains, which satisfied different socio-economic needs.\nFig.3 ñ Converting sal logs into sleepers in the Singhbhum forests, Chhotanagpur, May 1897.\nAdivasis were hired by the forest department to cut trees, and make smooth planks which would serve as sleepers for the\nrailways. At the same time, they were not allowed to cut these trees to build their own houses.\nNew words\nSleepers ñ Wooden planks laid across railway\ntracks; they hold the tracks in position\n\n-- 90 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n80\nBy the early nineteenth century, oak forests in England were\ndisappearing. This created a problem of timber supply for the Royal\nNavy. How could English ships be built without a regular supply of\nstrong and durable timber? How could imperial power be protected\nand maintained without ships? \tBy the 1820s, search parties were\nsent to explore the forest resources of India. Within a decade, trees\nwere being felled on a massive scale and vast quantities of timber\nwere being exported from India.\nThe spread of railways from the 1850s created a new demand.\nRailways were essential for colonial trade and for the movement of\nimperial troops. To run locomotives, wood was needed as fuel, and\nto lay railway lines sleepers were essential to hold the tracks together.\nEach mile of railway track required between 1,760 and 2,000 sleepers.\nFrom the 1860s, the railway network expanded rapidly. By 1890,\nabout 25,500 km of track had been laid. In 1946, the length of the\ntracks had increased to over 765,000 km. As the railway tracks spread\nthrough India, a larger and larger number of trees were felled. As\nearly as the 1850s, in the Madras Presidency alone, 35,000 trees were\nbeing cut annually for sleepers. The government gave out contracts\nto individuals to supply the required quantities. These contractors\nbegan cutting trees indiscriminately. Forests around the railway tracks\nfast started disappearing.\nFig.5 ñ Elephants piling squares of timber at a timber yard in Rangoon.\nIn the colonial period e lephants were frequently used to lift heavy timber both in the\nforests and at the timber yards.\nFig.4 ñ Bamboo rafts being floated down the\nKassalong river, Chittagong Hill Tracts.\n\n-- 91 of 189 --\n\nForest Society and Colonialism\n81\nActivity\nSource B\nëThe new line to be constructed was the Indus Valley Railway\nbetween Multan and Sukkur, a distance of nearly 300 miles. At\nthe rate of 2000 sleepers per mile this would require 600,000\nsleepers 10 feet by 10 inches by 5 inches (or 3.5 cubic feet\napiece), being upwards of 2,000,000 cubic feet. The\nlocomotives would use wood fuel. At the rate of one train daily\neither way and at one maund per train-mile an annual supply\nof 219,000 maunds would be demanded. In addition a large\nsupply of fuel for brick-burning would be required. The sleepers\nwould have to come mainly from the Sind Forests. The fuel\nfrom the tamarisk and Jhand forests of Sind and the Punjab.\nThe other new line was the Northern State Railway from Lahore\nto Multan. It was estimated that 2,200,000 sleepers would be\nrequired for its construction.í\nE.P. Stebbing, The Forests of India, Vol. II (1923).\nEach mile of railway track required between\n1,760 and 2,000 sleepers. If one average-\nsized tree yields 3 to 5 sleepers for a 3 metre\nwide broad gauge track, calculate\napproximately how many trees would have to\nbe cut to lay one mile of track.\nFig.7 - Truck carrying logs\nWhen the forest department decided to take up\nan area for logging, one of the first things it did\nwas to build wide roads so that trucks could\nenter. Compare this to the forest tracks along\nwhich people walk to collect fuelwood and\nother minor forest produce. Many such trucks\nof wood go from forest areas to big cities.\nFig.6 - Women returning home after collecting\nfuelwood.\n\n-- 92 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n82\n1.3 Plantations\nLarge areas of natural forests were also cleared to make way for\ntea, coffee and rubber plantations to meet Europeís growing need\nfor these commodities. The colonial government took over the\nforests, and gave vast areas to European planters at cheap rates.\nThese areas were enclosed and cleared of forests, and planted with\ntea or coffee.\nFig.8 ñ Pleasure Brand Tea.\n\n-- 93 of 189 --\n\nForest Society and Colonialism\n83\nIn the previous section we have seen that the British needed forests\nin order to build ships and railways. The British were worried that\nthe use of forests by local people and the reckless felling of trees by\ntraders would destroy forests. So they decided to invite a German\nexpert, Dietrich Brandis, for advice, and made him the first Inspector\nGeneral of Forests in India.\nBrandis realised that a proper system had to be introduced to manage\nthe forests and people had to be trained in the science of conservation.\nThis system would need legal sanction. Rules about the use of forest\nresources had to be framed. Felling of trees and grazing had to be\nrestricted so that forests could be preserved for timber production.\nAnybody who cut trees without following the system had to be\n2 The Rise of Commercial Forestry\nFig.9 ñ One aisle of a managed poplar forest\nin Tuscany, Italy.\nPoplar forests are good mainly for timber.\nThey are not used for leaves, fruit or other\nproducts.

This is the model that\nëscientificí forestry has promoted.\nActivity\nIf you were the Government of India in 1862\nand responsible for supplying the railways\nwith sleepers and fuel on such a large scale,\nwhat were the steps you would have taken?\n\n-- 94 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n84\nNew words\nScientific forestry ñ A system of cutting\ntrees controlled by the forest department,\nin which old trees are cut and new ones\nplanted\npunished. So Brandis set up the Indian Forest Service in 1864 and\nhelped formulate the Indian Forest Act of 1865. The Imperial Forest\nResearch Institute was set up at Dehradun in 1906. The system they\ntaught here was called ëscientific forestryí. Many people now,\nincluding ecologists, feel that this system is not scientific at all.\nIn scientific forestry, natural forests which had lots of different types\nof trees were cut down. In their place, one type of tree was planted\nin straight rows. This is called a plantation. Forest officials surveyed\nthe forests, estimated the area under different types of trees, and\nmade working plans for forest management. They planned how much\nof the plantation area to cut every year. The area cut was then to be\nreplanted so that it was ready to be cut again in some years.\nAfter the Forest Act was enacted in 1865, it was amended twice,\nonce in 1878 and then in 1927. The 1878 Act divided forests into\nthree categories: reserved, protected and village forests. The best\nforests were called ëreserved forestsí. Villagers could not take anything\nfrom these forests, even for their own use. For house building or\nfuel, they could take wood from protected or village forests.\n2.1 How were the Lives of People Affected?\nForesters and villagers had very different ideas of what a good forest\nshould look like. Villagers wanted forests with a mixture of species\nto satisfy different needs ñ fuel, fodder, leaves.

So particular species like teak and sal were\npromoted and others were cut.\nIn forest areas, people use forest products ñ roots, leaves, fruits, and\ntubers ñ for many things. Fruits and tubers are nutritious to eat,\nespecially during the monsoons before the harvest has come in. Herbs\nare used for medicine, wood for agricultural implements like yokes\nand ploughs, bamboo makes excellent fences and is also used to make\nbaskets and umbrellas. A dried scooped-out gourd can be used as a\nportable water bottle. Almost everything is available in the forest ñ\nleaves can be stitched together to make disposable plates and cups,\nthe siadi (Bauhinia vahlii) creeper can be used to make ropes, and the\nthorny bark of the semur (silk-cotton) tree is used to grate vegetables.\nOil for cooking and to light lamps can be pressed from the fruit of\nthe mahua tree.\nThe Forest Act meant severe hardship for villagers across the country.\nAfter the Act, all their everyday practices ñ cutting wood for their\nFig.12 ñ Collecting mahua ( Madhuca indica) from the forests.\nVillagers wake up before dawn and go to the forest to collect the mahua flowers which have fallen on the forest floor. Mahua\ntrees are precious. Mahua flowers can be eaten or used to make alcohol. The seeds can be used to make oil.\nFig.13 ñ Drying tendu leaves.\nThe sale of tendu leaves is a major source of\nincome for many people living in forests. Each\nbundle contains approximately 50 leaves, and if a\nperson works very hard they can perhaps collect\nas many as 100 bundles in a day. Women,\nchildren and old men are the main collectors.\n\n-- 96 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n86\nhouses, grazing their cattle, collecting fruits and roots, hunting and\nfishing \tñ \tbecame illegal. People were now forced to steal wood\nfrom the forests, and if they were caught, they were at the mercy of\nthe forest guards who would take bribes from them. Women who\ncollected fuelwood were especially worried. It was also common for\npolice constables and forest guards to harass people by demanding\nfree food from them.\n2.2 How did Forest Rules Affect Cultivation?\nOne of the major impacts of European colonialism was on the practice\nof shifting cultivation or swidden agriculture. This is a \ttraditional\nagricultural practice in many parts of Asia, Africa and South America. It\nhas many local names such as lading in Southeast Asia, milpa in Central\nAmerica, chitemene or tavy \tin Africa, and chena in Sri Lanka. \tIn\nIndia, dhya, penda, bewar, nevad, jhum, podu, khandad and \tkumri\nare some of the local terms for swidden agriculture.\nIn shifting cultivation, parts of the forest are cut and burnt in rotation.\nSeeds are sown in the ashes after the first monsoon rains, and the crop is\nharvested by October-November. Such plots are cultivated for a couple\nof years and then left fallow for 12 to 18 years for the forest to grow\nback. A mixture of crops is grown on these plots. In central India\nand Africa it could be millets, in Brazil manioc, and in other parts of\nLatin America maize and beans.\nEuropean foresters regarded this practice as harmful for the forests. They\nfelt that land which was used for cultivation every few years could not\ngrow trees for railway timber. When a forest was burnt, there was\nthe added danger of the flames spreading and burning valuable timber.\nActivity\nChildren living around forest areas can often\nidentify hundreds of species of trees and plants.\nHow many species of trees can you name?\nFig.14 ñ Bringing grain from the threshing\ngrounds to the field.\nThe men are carrying grain in baskets from the\nthreshing fields. Men carry the baskets slung\non a pole across their shoulders, while women\ncarry the baskets on their heads.\nFig.15 ñ Taungya cultivation was a system in\nwhich local farmers were allowed to cultivate\ntemporarily within a plantation. In this photo\ntaken in Tharrawaddy division in Burma in\n1921 the cultivators are sowing paddy. The\nmen make holes in the soil using long bamboo\npoles with iron tips. The women sow paddy\nin each hole.\n\n-- 97 of 189 --\n\nForest Society and Colonialism\n87\nShifting cultivation also made it harder for the government to calculate\ntaxes. Therefore, the government decided to ban shifting cultivation.\nAs a result, many communities were forcibly displaced from their\nhomes in the forests. Some had to change occupations, while some\nresisted through large and small rebellions.\n2.3 Who could Hunt?\nThe new forest laws changed the lives of forest dwellers in yet another\nway. Before the forest laws, many people who lived in or near forests\nhad survived by hunting deer, partridges and a variety of small\nanimals. This customary practice was prohibited by the forest laws.\nThose who were caught hunting were now punished for poaching.\nWhile the forest laws deprived people of their customary rights to\nhunt, hunting of big game became a sport. In India, hunting of tigers\nand other animals had been part of the culture of the court and\nnobility for centuries. Many Mughal paintings show princes and\nemperors enjoying a hunt. But under colonial rule the scale of hunting\nincreased to such an extent that various species became almost extinct.\nThe British saw large animals as signs of a wild, primitive and savage\nsociety. They believed that by killing dangerous animals the British\nFig.17 ñ The little fisherman.\nChildren accompany their parents to the forest\nand learn early how to fish, collect forest\nproduce and cultivate.

The seeds are then\nscattered in the area, and left to be irrigated by the rain.\n\n-- 98 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n88\nwould civilise India. They gave rewards for the killing of tigers, wolves\nand other large animals on the grounds that they posed a threat to\ncultivators. 0ver 80,000 tigers, 150,000 leopards and 200,000 wolves\nwere killed for reward in the period 1875-1925. Gradually, the tiger\ncame to be seen as a sporting trophy. The Maharaja of Sarguja alone\nshot 1,157 tigers and 2,000 leopards up to 1957. A British\nadministrator, George Yule, killed 400 tigers. Initially certain areas\nof forests were reserved for hunting. Only much later did\nenvironmentalists and conservators begin to argue that all these species\nof animals needed to be protected, and not killed.\n2.4 New Trades, New Employments and New Services\nWhile people lost out in many ways after the forest department\ntook control of the forests, some people benefited from the new\nopportunities that had opened up in trade. Many communities left\ntheir traditional occupations and started trading in forest products.\nThis happened not only in India but across the world. For example,\nFig.18 ñ Lord Reading hunting in Nepal.\nCount the dead tigers in the photo. When British colonial officials and Rajas went hunting they were accompanied by a\nwhole retinue of servants. Usually, the tracking was done by skilled village hunters, and the Sahib simply fired the shot.\nSource C\nBaigas are a forest community of\nCentral India. In 1892, after their\nshifting cultivation was stopped, they\npetitioned to the government:\nëW e daily starve, ha ving had no\nfoodgrain in our possession. The only\nwealth we possess is our ax e. We\nhave no clothes to cover our body with,\nbut we pass cold nights by the\nfireside. We are now dying for want of\nfood. We cannot go elsewhere.

From 1900-1912, the\nPutumayo output of 4000 tons of rubber\nwas associated with a decrease of some\n30,000 among the Indian population due\nto torture, disease and flight. A letter\nby an employee of a rubber company\ndescribes how the rubber was collected.\nThe manager summoned hundreds of\nIndians to the station:\nHe grasped his carbine and machete\nand began the slaughter of these\ndefenceless Indians, leaving the ground\ncovered with 150 corpses, among them,\nmen, women and children. Bathed in\nblood and appealing for mercy, the\nsurvivors were heaped with the dead\nand burned to death, while the manager\nshouted, ìI want to exterminate all the\nIndians who do not obey my orders\nabout the rubber that I require them to\nbring in.î í\nMichael Taussig, ëCulture of Terror-Space\nof \tDeathí, \tin \tNicholas \tDirks, \ted.\nColonialism and Culture, 1992.\nwith the growing demand for rubber in the mid-nineteenth century,\nthe Mundurucu peoples of the Brazilian Amazon who lived in villages\non high ground and cultivated manioc, began to collect latex from\nwild rubber trees for supplying to traders. Gradually, they descended\nto live in trading posts and became completely dependent on traders.\nIn India, the trade in forest products was not new. From the medieval\nperiod onwards, we have records of adivasi communities trading\nelephants and other goods like hides, horns, silk cocoons, ivory,\nbamboo, spices, fibres, grasses, gums and resins through nomadic\ncommunities like the Banjaras.\nWith the coming of the British, however, trade was completely\nregulated by the government. The British government gave many\nlarge European trading firms the sole right to trade in the forest\nproducts of particular areas. Grazing and hunting by local people\nwere restricted. In the process, many pastoralist and nomadic\ncommunities like the Korava, Karacha and Yerukula of the Madras\nPresidency lost their livelihoods. Some of them began to be called\nëcriminal tribesí, and were forced to work instead in factories,\nmines and plantations, under government supervision.\nNew opportunities of work did not always mean improved well-\nbeing for the people. In Assam, both men and women from forest\ncommunities like Santhals and Oraons from Jharkhand, and\nGonds from Chhattisgarh were recruited to work on tea\nplantations. Their wages were low and conditions of work were\nvery bad. They could not return easily to their home villages\nfrom where they had been recruited.\nSource\n\n-- 100 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n90\nIn many parts of India, and across the world, forest communities\nrebelled against the changes that were being imposed on them. The\nleaders of these movements against the British like Siddhu and Kanu\nin the Santhal Parganas, Birsa Munda of Chhotanagpur or Alluri\nSitarama Raju of Andhra Pradesh are still remembered today in songs\nand stories. We will now discuss in detail one such rebellion which\ntook place in the kingdom of Bastar in 1910.\n3.1 The People of Bastar\nBastar is located in the southernmost part of Chhattisgarh and\nborders Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and Maharashtra. The central part\nof Bastar is on a plateau. To the north of this plateau is the\nChhattisgarh plain and to its south is the Godavari plain. The river\nIndrawati winds across Bastar east to west. A number of different\ncommunities live in Bastar such as Maria and Muria Gonds, Dhurwas,\nBhatras and Halbas. They speak different languages but share\ncommon customs and beliefs. The people of Bastar believe that each\nvillage was given its land by the Earth, and in return, they look after\n3 Rebellion in the Forest\nFig.19 ñ Army camp in Bastar, 1910.\nThis photograph of an army camp was taken in Bastar in 1910. The\narmy moved with tents, cooks and soldiers. Here a sepoy is guarding the\ncamp against rebels.\nFig.20 ñ Bastar in 2000.\nIn 1947 Bastar kingdom was merged with\nKanker kingdom and become Bastar district in\nMadhya Pradesh. In 1998 it was divided\nagain into three districts, Kanker, Bastar and\nDantewada. In 2001, these became part of\nChhattisgarh. The 1910 rebellion first started\nin the Kanger forest area (encircled) and soon\nspread to other parts of the state.\nSketch map\nNot to scale.\n\n-- 101 of 189 --\n\nForest Society and Colonialism\n91\nSource E\nthe earth by making some offerings at each agricultural festival. In\naddition to the Earth, they show respect to the spirits of the river,\nthe forest and the mountain. Since each village knows where its\nboundaries lie, the local people look after all the natural resources\nwithin that boundary. \tIf people from a village want to take some\nwood from the forests of another village, they pay a small fee called\ndevsari, dand or man in exchange. Some villages also protect their forests\nby engaging watchmen and each household contributes some grain\nto pay them. Every year there is one big hunt where the headmen of\nvillages in a pargana (cluster of villages) meet and discuss issues of\nconcern, including forests.\n3.2 The Fears of the People\nWhen the colonial government proposed to reserve two-thirds of\nthe forest in 1905, and stop shifting cultivation, hunting and collection\nof forest produce, the people of Bastar were very worried. Some\nvillages were allowed to stay on in the reserved forests on the condition\nthat they worked free for the forest department in cutting and\ntransporting trees, and protecting the forest from fires. Subsequently,\nthese came to be known as ëforest villagesí. People of other villages\nwere displaced without any notice or compensation. For long,\nvillagers had been suffering from increased land rents and frequent\ndemands for free labour and goods by colonial officials. Then came\nthe terrible famines, in 1899-1900 and again in 1907-1908. Reservations\nproved to be the last straw.\nPeople began to gather and discuss these issues in their village councils,\nin bazaars and at festivals or wherever the headmen and priests of\nseveral villages were assembled. The initiative was taken by the\nDhurwas of the Kanger forest, where reservation first took place.\nAlthough there was no single leader, many people speak of Gunda\nDhur, from \tvillage Nethanar, as an important figure in the\nmovement. In 1910, mango boughs, a lump of earth, chillies and\narrows, began circulating between villages. These were actually\nmessages inviting villagers to rebel against the British. Every village\ncontributed something to the rebellion expenses. Bazaars were looted,\nthe houses of officials and traders, schools and police stations were\nburnt and robbed, and grain redistributed. Most of those who were\nattacked were in some way associated with the colonial state and its\noppressive laws. William Ward, a missionary who observed the events,\nwrote: ëFrom all directions came streaming into Jagdalpur, police,\nmerchants, forest peons, schoolmasters and immigrants.í\nëBhondia collected 400 men, sacrificed a\nnumber of goats and started off to\nintercept the Dewan who was expected\nto return from the direction of Bijapur.\nThis mob started on the 10th February,\nburnt the Marenga school, the police\npost, lines and pound at Keslur and the\nschool at Tokapal (Rajur), detached a\ncontingent to burn Karanji school and\ncaptured a head constable and four\nconstables of the State reserve police\nwho had been sent out to escort the\nDewan and bring him in. The mob did\nnot maltreat the guard seriously but\neased them of their weapons and let\nthem go. One party of rebels under\nBhondia Majhi went off to the Koer river\nto block the passage there in case the\nDewan left the main road. The rest went\non to Dilmilli to stop the main road from\nBijapur. Buddhu Majhi and Harchand Naik\nled the main body.í\nLetter from DeBrett, Political Agent,\nChhattisgarh \tFeudatory \tStates \tto\nCommissioner, Chhattisgarh Division, 23\nJune 1910.\n\n-- 102 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n92\nSource F\nElders living in Bastar recounted the story of this battle they had heard\nfrom their parents:\nPodiyami Ganga of Kankapal was told by his father Podiyami Tokeli that:\nëThe British came and started taking land. The Raja didnít pay attention\nto things happening around him, so seeing that land was being taken,\nhis supporters gathered people. War started. His staunch supporters\ndied and the rest were whipped. My father, Podiy ami Tokeli suffered many\nstrokes, but he escaped and survived. It was a movement to get rid of\nthe British. The British used to tie them to horses and pull them. From\nevery village two or three people went to Jagdalpur: Gargideva and\nMichk ola of Chidpal, Dole and Adrabundi of Markamiras, Vadapandu of\nBaleras, Unga of Palem and many others.í\nSimilarly, Chendru, an elder from village Nandrasa, said:\nëOn the peopleís side, were the big elders ñ Mille Mudaal of Palem, Soyekal\nDhurwa of Nandrasa, and Pandwa Majhi. People from every pargana\ncamped in Alnar tarai. The paltan (force) surrounded the people in a\nflash. Gunda Dhur had flying powers and flew a way. But what could those\nwith bows and arrows do? The battle took place at night. The people hid\nin shrubs and crawled away. The army paltan also ran away. All those\nwho remained alive (of the people), somehow found their way home to\ntheir villages.í\t\nSource\nThe British sent troops to suppress the rebellion. The adivasi leaders\ntried to negotiate, but the British surrounded their camps and fired\nupon them. After that they marched through the villages flogging\nand punishing those who had taken part in the rebellion. Most\nvillages were deserted as people fled into the jungles. It took three\nmonths (February - May) for the British to regain control. However,\nthey never managed to capture Gunda Dhur. In a major victory\nfor the rebels, work on reservation was temporarily suspended,\nand the area to be reserved was reduced to roughly half of that\nplanned before 1910.\nThe story of the forests and people of Bastar does not end there.\nAfter Independence, the same practice of keeping people out of the\nforests and reserving them for industrial use continued. In the 1970s,\nthe World Bank proposed that 4,600 hectares of natural sal forest\nshould be replaced by tropical pine to provide pulp for the paper\nindustry. It was only after protests by local environmentalists that\nthe project was stopped.\nLet us now go to another part of Asia, Indonesia, and see what was\nhappening there over the same period.\n\n-- 103 of 189 --\n\nForest Society and Colonialism\n93\nJava is now famous as a rice-producing island in Indonesia. But\nonce upon a time it was covered mostly with forests. The colonial\npower in Indonesia were the Dutch, and as we will see, there were\nmany similarities in the laws for forest control in Indonesia and\nIndia. \tJava in Indonesia is where the Dutch started forest\nmanagement. Like the British, they wanted timber from Java to\nbuild ships. In 1600, the population of Java was an estimated 3.4\nmillion. There were many villages in the fertile plains, but there\nwere also many communities living in the mountains and practising\nshifting cultivation.\n4.1 The Woodcutters of Java\nThe Kalangs of Java were a community of skilled forest cutters and\nshifting cultivators. They were so valuable that in 1755 when the\nMataram kingdom of Java split, the 6,000 Kalang families were\nequally divided between the two kingdoms. Without their expertise,\nit would have been difficult to harvest teak and for the kings to\nbuild their palaces. When the Dutch began to gain control over the\nforests in the eighteenth century, they tried to make the Kalangs\nwork under them. In 1770, the Kalangs resisted by attacking a Dutch\nfort at Joana, but the uprising was suppressed.\n4.2 Dutch Scientific Forestry\nIn the nineteenth century, when it became\nimportant to control territory and not just\npeople, the Dutch enacted forest laws in Java,\nrestricting villagersí access to forests. Now\nwood could only be cut for specified purposes\nlike making river boats or constructing houses,\nand only from specific forests under close\nsupervision. Villagers were punished for\ngrazing cattle in young stands, transporting\nwood without a permit, or travelling on forest\nroads with horse carts or cattle.\nAs in India, the need to manage forests for\nshipbuilding \tand \trailways \tled \tto \tthe\n4 Forest Transformations in Java\nFig.21 ñ Train transporting teak out of the forest ñ late colonial period.\n\n-- 104 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n94\nSource G\tintroduction of a forest service. In 1882, 280,000 sleepers were\nexported from Java alone. However, all this required labour to cut\nthe trees, transport the logs and prepare the sleepers. The Dutch\nfirst imposed rents on land being cultivated in the forest and then\nexempted some villages from these rents if they worked collectively\nto provide free labour and buffaloes for cutting and transporting\ntimber. This was known as the blandongdiensten system. Later, instead\nof rent exemption, forest villagers were given small wages, but their\nright to cultivate forest land was restricted.\n4.3 Samin’s Challenge\nAround 1890, Surontiko Samin of Randublatung village, a teak forest\nvillage, began questioning state ownership of the forest. He argued that\nthe state had not created the wind, water, earth and wood, so it could not\nown it. Soon a widespread movement developed. Amongst those who\nhelped organise it were Saminís sons-in-law. By 1907, 3,000 families\nwere following his ideas. Some of the Saminists protested by lying down\non their land when the Dutch came to survey it, while others refused to\npay taxes or fines or perform labour.\nDirk van Hogendorp, an official of the\nUnited East India Company in colonial\nJava said:\nëBatavians! Be amazed! Hear with\nwonder what I have to communicate. Our\nfleets \tare \tdestroyed, \tour \ttrade\nlanguishes, our navigation is going to\nruin ñ we purchase with immense\ntreasures, timber and other materials\nfor ship-building from the northern\npowers, and on Java we leave warlike\nand mercantile squadrons with their\nroots in the ground. Yes, the forests of\nJava have timber enough to build a\nrespectable navy in a short time, besides\nas many merchant ships as we require\nÖ In spite of all (the cutting) the forests\nof Java grow as fast as they are cut,\nand would be inexhaustible under good\ncare and management.í\nDirk van Hogendorp, cited in Peluso, Rich\nForests, Poor People, 1992.\nFig.22 ñ Most of Indonesiaís forests are located in islands like Sumatra, Kalimantan and West Irian. However, Java is\nwhere the Dutch began their ëscientific forestryí. The island, which is now famous for rice production, was once richly\ncovered with teak.\n\n-- 105 of 189 --\n\nForest Society and Colonialism\n95\n4.4 War and Deforestation\nThe First World War and the Second World War had a major impact\non forests. In India, working plans were abandoned at this time, and\nthe forest department cut trees freely to meet British war needs. In\nJava, just before the Japanese occupied the region, the Dutch followed\nëa scorched earthí policy, destroying sawmills, and burning huge\npiles of giant teak logs so that they would not fall into Japanese\nhands. The Japanese then exploited the forests recklessly for their\nown war industries, forcing forest villagers to cut down forests.\nMany villagers used this opportunity to expand cultivation in the\nforest. After the war, it was difficult for the Indonesian forest service\nto get this land back. As in India, peopleís need for agricultural land\nhas brought them into conflict with the forest departmentís desire\nto control the land and exclude people from it.\n4.5 New Developments in Forestry\nSince the 1980s, governments across Asia and Africa have begun to\nsee that scientific forestry and the policy of keeping forest\ncommunities \taway from forests has resulted in many conflicts.\nConservation of forests rather than collecting timber has become a\nmore important goal. The government has recognised that in order\nto meet this goal, the people who live near the forests must be\ninvolved. In many cases, across India, from Mizoram to Kerala, dense\nforests have survived only because villages protected them in sacred\ngroves known as sarnas, devarakudu, kan, rai, etc. Some villages have\nbeen patrolling their own forests, with each household taking it in\nturns, instead of leaving it to the forest guards. Local forest\ncommunities and environmentalists today are thinking of different\nforms of forest management.\nFig.23 ñ Indian Munitions Board, War Timber\nSleepers piled at Soolay pagoda ready for\nshipment,1917.\nThe Allies would not have been as successful\nin the First World War and the Second World\nWar if they had not been able to exploit the\nresources and people of their colonies.

In winter, when the high mountains were covered with\nsnow, they lived with their herds in the low hills of the Siwalik\nrange. The dry scrub forests here provided pasture for their herds.\nBy the end of April they began their northern march for their summer\ngrazing grounds. Several households came together for this journey,\nforming what is known as a kafila. They crossed the Pir Panjal passes\nand entered the valley of Kashmir. With the onset of summer, the\nsnow melted and the mountainsides were lush green. The variety of\ngrasses that sprouted provided rich nutritious forage for the animal\nherds. By end September the Bakarwals were on the move again, this\ntime on their downward journey, back to their winter base.

By September they began their return movement. On the\nway they stopped once again in the villages of Lahul and Spiti, reaping\ntheir summer harvest and sowing their winter crop. Then they descended\nwith their flock to their winter grazing ground on the Siwalik hills.\nNext April, once again, they began their march with their goats and\nsheep, to the summer meadows.\nFurther to the east, in Garhwal and Kumaon, the Gujjar cattle herders\ncame down to the dry forests of the bhabar in the\nwinter, and went up to the high meadows ñ the\nbugyals ñ in summer. Many of them were\noriginally from Jammu and came to the UP hills in\nthe nineteenth century in search of good pastures.\nThis pattern of cyclical movement between summer\nand winter pastures was typical of many pastoral\ncommunities of the Himalayas, including the\nBhotiyas, Sherpas and Kinnauris. All of them had\nto adjust to seasonal changes and make effective use\nof available pastures in different places. When the\npasture was exhausted or unusable in one place they\nmoved their herds and flock to new areas. This\ncontinuous movement also allowed the pastures to\nrecover; it prevented their overuse.\nFig.4 ñ Gaddi sheep being sheared.\nBy September the Gaddi shepherds come down from the high\nmeadows (Dhars).

They were also to be\nfound in the plateaus, plains and deserts of India.\nDhangars were an important pastoral community of Maharashtra.\nIn the early twentieth century their population in this region was\nestimated to be 467,000. Most of them were shepherds, some were\nblanket weavers, and still others were buffalo herders. The Dhangar\nshepherds stayed in the central plateau of Maharashtra during the\nmonsoon. This was a semi-arid region with low rainfall and poor\nsoil. It was covered with thorny scrub. Nothing but dry crops like\nbajra could be sown here. In the monsoon this tract became a vast\ngrazing ground for the Dhangar flocks. By October the Dhangars\nharvested their bajra and started on their move west. After a march\nof about a month they reached the Konkan. This was a flourishing\nagricultural tract with high rainfall and rich soil. Here the shepherds\nwere welcomed by Konkani peasants. After the kharif harvest was\ncut at this time, the fields had to be fertilised and made ready for the\nrabi harvest. Dhangar flocks manured the fields and fed on the\nstubble. The Konkani peasants also gave supplies of rice which the\nshepherds took back to the plateau where grain was scarce. With the\nonset of the monsoon the Dhangars left the Konkan and the coastal\nareas with their flocks and returned to their settlements on the dry\nplateau. The sheep could not tolerate the wet monsoon conditions.\nNew words\nKharif ñ The autumn crop, usually harvested\nbetween September and October\nRabi ñ The spring crop, usually harvested\nafter March\nStubble ñ Lower ends of grain stalks left in\nthe ground after harvesting\nFig.5 ñ Raika camels grazing\non the Thar desert in western\nRajasthan.\nOnly camels can survive on the\ndry and thorny bushes that can\nbe found here; but to get\nenough feed they have to graze\nover a very extensive area.\n\n-- 111 of 189 --\n\nPastoralists in the Modern World\n101\nActivity\nSource B\nIn Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, again, the dry central plateau was\ncovered with stone and grass, inhabited by cattle, goat and sheep\nherders. The Gollas herded cattle. The Kurumas and Kurubas reared\nsheep and goats and sold woven blankets. They lived near the woods,\ncultivated small patches of land, engaged in a variety of petty trades\nand took care of their herds. Unlike the mountain pastoralists, it\nwas not the cold and the snow that defined the seasonal rhythms of\ntheir movement: rather it was the alternation of the monsoon and\ndry season. In the dry season they moved to the coastal tracts, and\nleft when the rains came. Only buffaloes liked the swampy, wet\nconditions of the coastal areas during the monsoon months. Other\nherds had to be shifted to the dry plateau at this time.\nBanjaras were yet another well-known group of graziers. They were\nto be found in the villages of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan,\nMadhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. In search of good pastureland\nfor their cattle, they moved over long distances, selling plough cattle\nand other goods to villagers in exchange for grain and fodder.\nThe accounts of many travellers tell us about the life of pastoral\ngroups. In the early nineteenth century, Buchanan visited the\nGollas during his travel through Mysore. He wrote:\nëTheir families live in small villages near the skirt of the woods,\nwhere they cultivate a little ground, and keep some of their\ncattle, selling in the towns the produce of the dairy.\nTheir families are very numerous, seven to eight young men in\neach being common. Two or three of these attend the flocks in\nthe woods, while the remainder cultivate their fields, and supply\nthe towns with firewood, and with straw for thatch.í\nFrom: Francis Hamilton Buchanan, A Journey from Madras through\nthe Countries of Mysore, Canara and Malabar (London, 1807).\nRead Sources A and B.\n! Write briefly about what they tell you about\nthe nature of the work undertaken by men\nand women in pastoral households.\n! Why do you think pastoral groups often\nlive on the edges of forests?\nIn the deserts of Rajasthan lived the Raikas. The rainfall in\nthe region was meagre and uncertain. On cultivated land,\nharvests fluctuated every year. Over vast stretches no crop\ncould be grown. So the Raikas combined cultivation with\npastoralism. During the monsoons, the Raikas of Barmer,\nJaisalmer, Jodhpur and Bikaner stayed in their home villages,\nwhere pasture was available. By October, when these grazing\ngrounds were dry and exhausted, they moved out in search\nof other pasture and water, and returned again during the\nnext monsoon. One group of Raikas ñ known as the Maru\n(desert) Raikas ñ herded camels and another group reared\nsheep and goat.\nFig.6 ñ A camel herder in his settlement.\nThis is on the Thar desert near Jaisalmer in Rajasthan.\nThe camel herders of the region are Maru (desert)\nRaikas, and their settlement is called a dhandi.\n\n-- 112 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n102\nSo we see that the life of these pastoral groups was sustained by a\ncareful consideration of a host of factors. They had to judge how\nlong the herds could stay in one area, and know where they could\nfind water and pasture. They needed to calculate the timing of their\nmovements, and ensure that they could move through different\nterritories. They had to set up a relationship with farmers on the\nway, so that the herds could graze in harvested fields and manure the\nsoil. They combined a range of different activities ñ cultivation, trade,\nand herding ñ to make their living.\nHow did the life of pastoralists change under colonial rule?\nFig.7 ñ A camel fair at Balotra in western Rajasthan. Camel herders come to the fair to sell and buy camels. The Maru\nRaikas also display their expertise in training their camels.

Their agricultural stock\ndeclined and their trades and crafts were adversely affected. How?\nFirst, the colonial state wanted to transform all grazing lands\ninto cultivated farms. Land revenue was one of the main sources\nof its finance. By expanding cultivation it could increase its revenue\ncollection. It could at the same time produce more jute, cotton,\nwheat and other agricultural produce that were required in\nEngland. To colonial officials all uncultivated land appeared to\nbe unproductive: it produced neither revenue nor agricultural\nproduce. It was seen as ëwaste landí that needed to be brought\nunder cultivation. From the mid-nineteenth century, Waste Land\nRules were enacted in various parts of the country. By these Rules\nuncultivated lands were taken over and given to select individuals.\nThese individuals were granted various concessions and encouraged\nto settle these lands. Some of them were made headmen of villages\nin the newly cleared areas. In most areas the lands taken over\nwere actually grazing tracts used regularly by pastoralists. So\nexpansion of cultivation inevitably meant the decline of pastures\nand a problem for pastoralists.\nSecond, by the mid-nineteenth century, various Forest Acts were\nalso being enacted in the different provinces. Through these Acts\nsome forests which produced commercially valuable timber like\ndeodar or sal were declared ëReservedí. No pastoralist was allowed\naccess to these forests. Other forests were classified as ëProtectedí.\nIn these, some customary grazing rights of pastoralists were\ngranted but their movements were severely restricted. The\ncolonial officials believed that grazing destroyed the saplings and\nyoung shoots of trees that germinated on the forest floor. The\nherds trampled over the saplings and munched away the shoots.\nThis prevented new trees from growing.\nThese Forest Acts changed the lives of pastoralists. They were\nnow prevented from entering many forests that had earlier\nprovided valuable forage for their cattle. Even in the areas they\nwere allowed entry, their movements were regulated. They needed\na permit for entry. The timing of their entry and departure was\n2\t2\t2\t2\t2 Colonial\tColonial\tColonial\tColonial\tColonial R\tR\tR\tR\tRule and\tule and\tule and\tule and\tule and P\tP\tP\tP\tPastoral\tastoral\tastoral\tastoral\tastoral L\tL\tL\tL\tLife\tife\tife\tife\tife\nH.S. Gibson, the Deputy Conservator of\nForests, Darjeeling, wrote in 1913:\nëÖ forest which is used for grazing cannot\nbe used for any other purpose and is\nunable to yield timber and fuel, which are\nthe main legitimate forest produce Öí\nWrite a comment on the closure of the forests\nto grazing from the standpoint of:\n! a forester\n! a pastoralist\nNew words\nCustomary \trights ñ Rights that people are\nused to by custom and tradition\n\n-- 115 of 189 --\n\nPastoralists in the Modern World\n105\nActivity\nSource D\tspecified, and the number of days they could spend in the forest\nwas limited. Pastoralists could no longer remain in an area even if\nforage was available, the grass was succulent and the undergrowth\nin the forest was ample. They had to move because the Forest\nDepartment permits that had been issued to them now ruled their\nlives. The permit specified the periods in which they could be\nlegally within a forest. If they overstayed they were liable to fines.\nThird, British officials were suspicious of nomadic people. They\ndistrusted mobile craftsmen and traders who hawked their goods\nin villages, and pastoralists who changed their places of residence\nevery season, moving in search of good pastures for their herds.\nThe colonial government wanted to rule over a settled population.\nThey wanted the rural people to live in villages, in fixed places\nwith fixed rights on particular fields. Such a population was easy\nto identify and control. Those who were settled were seen as\npeaceable and law abiding; those who were nomadic were\nconsidered to be criminal. In 1871, the colonial government in\nIndia passed the Criminal Tribes Act. \tBy this Act many\ncommunities of craftsmen, traders and pastoralists were classified\nas Criminal Tribes. They were stated to be criminal by nature\nand birth. Once this Act came into force, these communities were\nexpected to live only in notified village settlements. They were\nnot allowed to move out without a permit. The village police\nkept a continuous watch on them.\nFourth, to expand its revenue income, the colonial government\nlooked for every possible source of taxation. So tax was imposed\non land, on canal water, on salt, on trade goods, and even on\nanimals. Pastoralists had to pay tax on every animal they grazed\non the pastures. In most pastoral tracts of India, grazing tax was\nintroduced in the mid-nineteenth century. The tax per head of\ncattle went up rapidly and the system of collection was made\nincreasingly efficient. In the decades between the 1850s and 1880s\nthe right to collect the tax was auctioned out to contractors. These\ncontractors tried to extract as high a tax as they could to recover\nthe money they had paid to the state and earn as much profit as\nthey could within the year. By the 1880s the government began\ncollecting taxes directly from the pastoralists. Each of them was\ngiven a pass. To enter a grazing tract, a cattle herder had to show\nthe pass and pay the tax. The number of cattle heads he had and\nthe amount of tax he paid was entered on the pass.\nIn the 1920s, a Royal Commission on\nAgriculture reported:\nëThe extent of the area available for\ngrazing has gone down tremendously\nwith the extension of area under\ncultivation \tbecause \tof \tincreasing\npopulation, extension of irrigation\nfacilities, acquiring the pastures for\nGovernment purposes, for example,\ndefence, industries and agricultural\nexperimental farms. [Now] breeders find\nit difficult to raise large herds. Thus their\nearnings have gone down. The quality\nof their livestock has deteriorated,\ndietary standards have fallen and\nindebtedness has increased.í\nThe Report of the Royal Commission of\nAgriculture in India, 1928.\nImagine you are living in the 1890s.\nYou belong to a community of nomadic\npastoralists and craf tsmen.

When grazing\nlands were taken over and turned into cultivated fields, the available\narea of pastureland declined. Similarly, the reservation of forests\nmeant that shepherds and cattle herders could no longer freely pasture\ntheir cattle in the forests.\nAs pasturelands disappeared under the plough, the existing animal\nstock had to feed on whatever grazing land remained. This led to\ncontinuous intensive grazing of these pastures. Usually nomadic\npastoralists grazed their animals in one area and moved to another\narea. These pastoral movements allowed time for the natural\nrestoration of vegetation growth. When restrictions were imposed\non pastoral movements, grazing lands came to be continuously used\nand the quality of patures declined. This in turn created a further\nshortage of forage for animals and the deterioration of animal stock.\nUnderfed cattle died in large numbers during scarcities and famines.\nFig.11 ñ Pastoralists in India.\nThis map indicates the location of only those\npastoral communities mentioned in the\nchapter. There are many others living in\nvarious parts of India.\n\n-- 117 of 189 --\n\nPastoralists in the Modern World\n107\n2.2 How Did the Pastoralists Cope with these Changes?\nPastoralists reacted to these changes in a variety of ways. Some\nreduced the number of cattle in their herds, since there was not\nenough pasture to feed large numbers. Others discovered new\npastures when movement to old grazing grounds became difficult.\nAfter 1947, the camel and sheep herding Raikas, for instance, could\nno longer move into Sindh and graze their camels on the banks of\nthe Indus, as they had done earlier. The new political boundaries\nbetween India and Pakistan stopped their movement. So they had\nto find new places to go. In recent years they have been migrating\nto Haryana where sheep can graze on agricultural fields after the\nharvests are cut. This is the time that the fields need manure that\nthe animals provide.\nOver the years, some richer pastoralists began buying land and\nsettling down, giving up their nomadic life. Some became settled\npeasants cultivating land, others took to more extensive trading.\nMany poor pastoralists, on the other hand, borrowed money from\nmoneylenders to survive. At times they lost their cattle and sheep\nand became labourers, working on fields or in small towns.\nYet, pastoralists not only continue to survive, in many regions\ntheir numbers have expanded over recent decades. When\npasturelands in one place was closed to them, they changed the\ndirection of their movement, reduced the size of the herd, combined\npastoral activity with other forms of income and adapted to the\nchanges in the modern world. Many ecologists believe that in dry\nregions and in the mountains, pastoralism is still ecologically the\nmost viable form of life.\nSuch changes were not experienced only by pastoral communities\nin India. In many other parts of the world, new laws and settlement\npatterns forced pastoral communities to alter their lives. How did\npastoral communities elsewhere cope with these changes in the\nmodern world?\n\n-- 118 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n108\nLet us move to Africa where over half the worldís pastoral population\nlives. Even today, over 22 million Africans depend on some form of\npastoral activity for their livelihood. They include communities like\nBedouins, Berbers, Maasai, Somali, Boran and Turkana. Most of\nthem now live in the semi-arid grasslands or arid deserts where rainfed\nagriculture is difficult. They raise cattle, camels, goats, sheep and\ndonkeys; and they sell milk, meat, animal skin and wool. Some also\nearn through trade and transport, others combine pastoral activity\nwith agriculture; still others do a variety of odd jobs to supplement\ntheir meagre and uncertain earnings from pastoralism.\nLike pastoralists in India, the lives of African pastoralists have changed\ndramatically over the colonial and post-colonial periods.

Courtesy: The Massai Association.\n\n-- 119 of 189 --\n\nPastoralists in the Modern World\n109\nWe will discuss some of these changes by looking at one pastoral\ncommunity ñ the Maasai ñ in some detail. The Maasai cattle herders\nlive primarily in east Africa: 300, 000 in southern Kenya and another\n150,000 in Tanzania. We will see how new laws and regulations took\naway their land and restricted their movement. This affected their\nlives in times of drought and even reshaped their social relationships.\n3.1 Where have the Grazing Lands Gone?\nOne of the problems the Maasais have faced is the continuous loss of\ntheir grazing lands. Before colonial times, Maasailand stretched over\na vast area from north Kenya to the steppes of northern Tanzania.\nIn the late nineteenth century, European imperial powers scrambled\nfor territorial possessions in Africa, slicing up the region into different\ncolonies. In 1885, Maasailand was cut into half with an international\nboundary between British Kenya and German Tanganyika.\nSubsequently, the best grazing lands were gradually taken over for\nwhite settlement and the Maasai were pushed into a small area in\nFig.13 ñ Pastoral communities in Africa.\nThe inset shows the location of the Maasais in Kenya and Tanzania.\nOn Tanganyika\nBritain conquered what had been German East\nAfrica during the First W orld War. In 1919\nTanganyika came under British control. It\nattained independence in 1961 and united with\nZanzibar to form Tanzania in 1964.\n\n-- 120 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n110\nsouth Kenya and north Tanzania. The Maasai lost about 60 per cent\nof their pre-colonial lands. They were confined to an arid zone with\nuncertain rainfall and poor pastures.\nFrom the late nineteenth century, the British colonial government\nin east Africa also encouraged local peasant communities to expand\ncultivation. As cultivation expanded, pasturelands were turned into\ncultivated fields. In pre-colonial times, the Maasai pastoralists had\ndominated their agricultural neighbours both economically and\npolitically. By the end of colonial rule the situation had reversed.\nLarge areas of grazing land were also turned into game reserves like\nthe Maasai Mara and Samburu National Park in Kenya and Serengeti\nPark in Tanzania. Pastoralists were not allowed to enter these\nreserves; they could neither hunt animals nor graze their herds in\nthese areas. Very often these reserves were in areas that had\ntraditionally been regular grazing grounds for Maasai herds. The\nSerengeti National Park, for instance, was created over 14,760 km.\nof Maasai grazing land.\nFig.14 ñ Without grass, livestock (cattle, goats and sheep) are malnourished, which means less food available for families\nand their children. The areas hardest hit by drought and food shortage are in the vicinity of Amboseli National Park, which\nlast year generated approximately 240 million Kenyan Shillings (estimated $3.5 million US) from tourism. In addition, the\nKilimanjaro Water Project cuts through the communities of this area but the villagers are barred from using the water for\nirrigation or for livestock.Courtesy: The Massai Association.\n\n-- 121 of 189 --\n\nPastoralists in the Modern World\n111\nSource E\nPastoral communities elsewhere in Africa faced similar problems.\nIn Namibia, in south-west Africa, the Kaokoland herders\ntraditionally \tmoved \tbetween \tKaokoland \tand \tnearby\nOvamboland, and they sold skin, meat and other trade\nproducts in neighbouring markets. All this was stopped with\nthe new system of territorial boundaries that restricted\nmovements between regions.\nThe nomadic cattle herders of Kaokoland in Namibia\ncomplained:\nëWe have difficulty. We cry. We are imprisoned. We do not know\nwhy we are locked up. We are in jail. We have no place to live\nÖ We cannot get meat from the south Ö Our sleeping skins\ncannot be sent out Ö Ovamboland is closed for us. We lived in\nOvamboland for a long time. We want to take our cattle there,\nalso our sheep and goats. The borders are closed. The borders\npress us heavily. We cannot live.í\nStatement of Kaokoland herders, Namibia, 1949.\nQuoted in Michael Bollig, ëThe colonial encapsulation of the north\nwestern Namibian pastoral economyí, Africa 68 (4), 1998.\nFig.15 ñ The title Maasai derives from the word Maa. Maa-sai means 'My People'. The Maasai\nare traditionally nomadic and pastoral people who depend on milk and meat for subsistence.\nHigh temperatures combine with low rainfall to create conditions which are dry, dusty, and\nextremely hot. Drought conditions are common in this semi-arid land of equatorial heat. During\nsuch times pastoral animals die in large numbes. Courtesy: The Massai Association.\n\n-- 122 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n112\nThe loss of the finest grazing lands and water resources created\npressure on the small area of land that the Maasai were confined\nwithin. Continuous grazing within a small area inevitably meant a\ndeterioration of the quality of pastures. Fodder was always in short\nsupply. Feeding the cattle became a persistent problem.\n3.2 The Borders are Closed\nIn the nineteenth century, African pastoralists could move over vast\nareas in search of pastures. When the pastures were exhausted in one\nplace they moved to a different area to graze their cattle. From the\nlate nineteenth century, the colonial government began imposing\nvarious restrictions on their mobility.\nLike the Maasai, other pastoral groups were also forced to live within\nthe confines of special reserves. The boundaries of these reserves\nbecame the limits within which they could now move. They were\nnot allowed to move out with their stock without special permits.\nAnd it was difficult to get permits without trouble and harassment.\nThose found guilty of disobeying the rules were severely punished.\nPastoralists were also not allowed to enter the markets in white areas.\nIn many regions, they were prohibited from participating in any\nform of trade. White settlers and European colonists saw pastoralists\nas dangerous and savage ñ people with whom all contact had to be\nminimised. Cutting off all links was, however, never really possible,\nbecause white colonists had to depend on black labour to bore mines\nand, build roads and towns.\nThe new territorial boundaries and restrictions imposed on them\nsuddenly changed the lives of pastoralists. This adversely affected\nSource F\nIn most places in colonial Africa, the police were given instructions to keep a\nwatch on the movements of pastoralists, and prevent them from entering white\nareas. The following is one such instruction given by a magistrate to the police,\nin south-west Africa, restricting the movements of the pastoralists of Kaokoland\nin Namibia:\nëPasses to enter the Territory should not be given to these Natives unless\nexceptional circumstances necessitate their entering Ö The object of the above\nproclamation is to restrict the number of natives entering the Territory and to\nkeep a check on them, and ordinary visiting passes should therefore never be\nissued to them.í\nëKaokoveld permits to enterí, Magistrate to Police Station Commanders of Outjo\nand Kamanjab, 24 November, 1937.\t\nSource\n\n-- 123 of 189 --\n\nPastoralists in the Modern World\n113\nboth their pastoral and trading activities. Earlier, pastoralists not\nonly looked after animal herds but traded in various products. The\nrestrictions under colonial rule did not entirely stop their trading\nactivities but they were now subject to various restrictions.\n3.3 When Pastures Dry\nDrought affects the life of pastoralists everywhere. When rains fail\nand pastures are dry, cattle are likely to starve unless they can be\nmoved to areas where forage is available. That is why, traditionally,\npastoralists are nomadic; they move from place to place. This\nnomadism allows them to survive bad times and avoid crises.\nBut from the colonial period, the Maasai were bound down to a\nfixed area, confined within a reserve, and prohibited from moving\nin search of pastures. They were cut off from the best grazing lands\nand forced to live within a semi-arid tract prone to frequent droughts.\nSince they could not shift their cattle to places where pastures were\navailable, large numbers of Maasai cattle died of starvation and disease\nin these years of drought. An enquiry in 1930 showed that the Maasai\nin Kenya possessed 720,000 cattle, 820,000 sheep and 171,000 donkeys.\nIn just two years of severe drought, 1933 and 1934, over half the\ncattle in the Maasai Reserve died.\nAs the area of grazing lands shrank, the adverse effect of the droughts\nincreased in intensity. The frequent bad years led to a steady decline\nof the animal stock of the pastoralists.\n3.4 Not All were Equally Affected\nIn Maasailand, as elsewhere in Africa, not all pastoralists were equally\naffected by the changes in the colonial period. In pre-colonial times\nMaasai society was divided into two social categories ñ elders and\nwarriors. The elders formed the ruling group and met in periodic\ncouncils to decide on the affairs of the community and settle disputes.\nThe warriors consisted of younger people, mainly responsible for\nthe protection of the tribe. They defended the community and\norganised cattle raids. Raiding was important in a society where cattle\nwas wealth. It is through raids that the power of different pastoral\ngroups was asserted. Young men came to be recognised as members\nof the warrior class when they proved their manliness by raiding\nthe cattle of other pastoral groups and participating in wars. They,\nhowever, were subject to the authority of the elders.\nFig.16 ñ Note how the warriors wear\ntraditional deep red shukas, brightly beaded\nMaasai jewelry and carry five-foot, steel tipped\nspears. Their long pleats of intricately plaited\nhair are tinted red with ochre.

They\nappointed chiefs of different sub-groups of Maasai, who were\nmade responsible for the affairs of the tribe. The British\ni m p o s e d v a r i o u s r e s t r i c t i o n s o n r a i d i n g a n d w a r f a r e.\nConsequently, the traditional authority of both elders and\nwarriors was adversely affected.\nThe chiefs appointed by the colonial government often\naccumulated wealth over time. They had a regular income with\nwhich they could buy animals, goods and land. They lent\nmoney to poor neighbours who needed cash to pay taxes. Many\nof them began living in towns, and became involved in trade.\nTheir wives and children stayed back in the villages to look\nafter the animals. These chiefs managed to survive the\ndevastations of war and drought. They had both pastoral and\nnon-pastoral income, and could buy animals when their stock\nwas depleted.\nBut the life history of the poor pastoralists who depended only\non their livestock was different. Most often, they did not have\nthe resources to tide over bad times. In times of war and famine,\nthey lost nearly everything. They had to go looking for work\nin the towns. Some eked out a living as charcoal burners, others\ndid odd jobs.

Second, a new distinction between the wealthy and poor\npastoralists developed.\nConclusion\nSo we see that pastoral communities in different parts of the world\nare affected in a variety of different ways by changes in the modern\nworld. New laws and new borders affect the patterns of their\nmovement. With increasing restrictions on their mobility,\npastoralists find it difficult to move in search of pastures. As pasture\nlands disappear grazing becomes a problem, while pastures that\nremain deteriorate through continuous over grazing. Times of\ndrought become times of crises, when cattle die in large numbers.\nYet, pastoralists do adapt to new times. They change the paths of\ntheir annual movement, reduce their cattle numbers, press for rights\nto enter new areas, exert political pressure on the government for\nrelief, subsidy and other forms of support and demand a right in\nthe management of forests and water resources. Pastoralists are not\nrelics of the past. They are not people who have no place in the\nmodern world. Environmentalists and economists have increasingly\ncome to recognise that pastoral nomadism is a form of life that is\nperfectly suited to many hilly and dry regions of the world.\nFig.18 ñ A Raika shepherd on Jaipur highway.\nHeavy traffic on highways has made migration of shepherds a new experience.\n\n-- 126 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n116\nQuestions\n?\nActivities\n1.

In\nthe months that followed, cases of such fire were reported from\nnumerous districts. At times only the rick was burnt, at other times\nthe entire farmhouse. Then on the night of 28 August 1830, a threshing\nmachine of a farmer was destroyed by labourers in East Kent in\nEngland. In the subsequent two years, riots spread over southern\nEngland and about 387 threshing machines were broken. Through\nthis period, farmers received threatening letters urging them to stop\nusing machines that deprived workmen of their livelihood. Most of\nthese letters were signed in the name of Captain Swing. Alarmed\nlandlords feared attacks by armed bands at night, and many destroyed\ntheir own machines. Government action was severe. Those suspected\nof rioting were rounded up. 1, 976 prisoners were tried, nine men\nwere hanged, 505 transported ñ over 450 of them to Australia ñ and\n644 put behind bars.\nCaptain Swing was a mythic name used in these letters. But who\nwere the Swing rioters? Why did they break threshing machines?\nWhat were they protesting against? To answer these questions, we\nneed to trace the developments in English agriculture in the eighteenth\nand nineteenth centuries.\n1.1 The Time of Open fields and Commons\nOver the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries the English\ncountryside changed dramatically. Before this time in large parts of\nEngland the countryside was open. It was not partitioned into\nenclosed lands privately owned by landlords. Peasants cultivated on\nstrips of land around the village they lived in. At the beginning of\neach year, at a public meeting, each villager was allocated a number\nof strips to cultivate. Usually, these strips were of varying quality\nand often located in different places, not next to each other. The\neffort was to ensure that everyone had a mix of good and bad land.\nBeyond these strips of cultivation lay the common land. All villagers\nhad access to the commons. Here they pastured their cows and grazed\ntheir sheep, collected fuelwood for fire and berries and fruit for food.\nThey fished in the rivers and ponds, and hunted rabbit in common\nforests. For the poor, the common land was essential for survival. It\n1 \tThe Coming of Modern Agriculture in England\nThe threatening letters circulated widely.\nAt times the threats were gentle, at\nothers severe.

When\nthe price of wool went up in the world market in the sixteenth\ncentury, rich farmers wanted to expand wool production to earn\nprofits. They were eager to improve their sheep breeds and ensure\ngood feed for them. They were keen on controlling large areas of\nland in compact blocks to allow improved breeding. So they began\ndividing and enclosing common land and building hedges around\ntheir holdings to separate their property from that of others. They\ndrove out villagers who had small cottages on the commons, and\nthey prevented the poor from entering the enclosed fields.\nTill the middle of the eighteenth century the enclosure movement\nproceeded very slowly. The early enclosures were usually created by\nindividual landlords. They were not supported by the state or the\nchurch. After the mid-eighteenth century, however, the enclosure\nmovement swept through the countryside, changing the English\nlandscape for ever. Between 1750 and 1850, 6 million acres of land\nwas enclosed. The British Parliament no longer watched this process\nfrom a distance. It passed 4,000 Acts legalising these enclosures.\nFig.1 ñ Threshing machines broken in different counties of England\nduring the Captain Swing movement.(1830-32)\nBased on E. J.

What did the\nenclosures imply? The new enclosures were different from the old.\nUnlike the sixteenth-century enclosures that promoted sheep farming,\nthe land being enclosed in the late eighteenth century was for grain\nproduction. The new enclosures were happening in a different context;\nthey became a sign of a changing time. From the mid-eighteenth\ncentury, the English population expanded rapidly. Between 1750 and\n1900, it multiplied over four times, mounting from 7 million in 1750\nto 21 million in 1850 and 30 million in 1900. This meant an increased\ndemand for foodgrains to feed the population. Moreover, Britain at\nthis time was industrialising. More and more people began to live\nand work in urban areas. Men from rural areas migrated to towns in\nsearch of jobs. To survive they had to buy foodgrains in the market.\nAs the urban population grew, the market for foodgrains expanded,\nand when demand increased rapidly, foodgrain prices rose.\nBy the end of the eighteenth century, France was at war with England.\nThis disrupted trade and the import of foodgrains from Europe.\nPrices of foodgrains in England sky rocketed, encouraging landowners\nto enclose lands and enlarge the area under grain cultivation. Profits\nflowed in and landowners pressurised the Parliament to pass the\nEnclosure Acts.\nActivity\nLook at the graph carefully.

In earlier times,\nrapid population growth was most often followed by a period of\nfood shortages. Food-grain production in the past had not expanded\nas rapidly as the population. In the nineteenth century this did not\nhappen in England. Grain production grew as quickly as population.\nEven though the population increased rapidly, in 1868 England\nwas producing \tabout 80 per cent of the food it consumed. The\nrest was imported.\nThis increase in food-grain production was made possible not by\nany radical innovations in agricultural technology, but by bringing\nnew lands under cultivation. Landlords sliced up pasturelands, carved\nup open fields, cut up forest commons, took over marshes, and\nturned larger and larger areas into agricultural fields.\nFarmers at this time continued to use the simple innovations in\nagriculture that had become common by the early eighteenth\nFig.3 ñ Suffolk countryside in the early nineteenth century.\nThis is a painting by the English painter John Constable (1776 -1837). Son of a wealthy corn merchant, he grew up in the\nSuffolk countryside in east England, a region that had been enclosed much before the nineteenth century. At a time when\nthe idyllic countryside was disappearing, the open fields were being enclosed, Constable painted sentimental images of open\ncountryside. In this particular painting we do see some fences and the separation of fields, but we get no idea of what was\nhappening in the landscape. Constable's paintings usually did not have working people. If you look at Fig.1, you will see that\nSuffolk was surrounded by regions where threshing machines were broken in large numbers during the Swing riots.\nFig.4 ñ Enclosures of common field by\nParliamentary Acts: eighteenth-nineteenth\ncenturies.\nBased on E. J. Hobsbawm and George Rude,\nCaptain Swing.\n\n-- 132 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n122\ncentury. It was in about the 1660s that farmers in many parts of England\nbegan growing turnip and clover. They soon discovered that planting\nthese crops improved the soil and made it more fertile. Turnip was,\nmoreover, a good fodder crop relished by cattle. So farmers began\ncultivating turnips and clover regularly. These crops became part of\nthe cropping system. Later findings showed that these crops had the\ncapacity to increase the nitrogen content of the soil. Nitrogen was\nimportant for crop growth. Cultivation of the same soil over a few\nyears depleted the nitrogen in the soil and reduced its fertility. By\nrestoring nitrogen, turnip and clover made the soil fertile once again.\nWe find that farmers in the early nineteenth century used much the\nsame method to improve agriculture on a more regular basis.\nEnclosures were now seen as necessary to make long-term investments\non land and plan crop rotations to improve the soil. Enclosures also\nallowed the richer landowners to expand the land under their control\nand produce more for the market.\n1.4 What Happened To the Poor?\nEnclosures filled the pockets of landlords. But what happened to those\nwho depended on the commons for their survival? When fences came\nup, the enclosed land became the exclusive property of one landowner.\nThe poor could no longer collect their firewood from the forests, or\ngraze their cattle on the commons. They could no longer collect apples\nand berries, or hunt small animals for meat. Nor could they gather the\nstalks that lay on the fields after the crops were cut. Everything belonged\nto the landlords, everything had a price which the poor could not\nafford to pay.\nIn places where enclosures happened on an extensive scale ñ particularly\nthe Midlands and the counties around ñ the poor were displaced from\nthe land. They found their customary rights gradually disappearing.\nDeprived of their rights and driven off the land, they tramped in search\nof work. From the Midlands, they moved to the southern counties of\nEngland. This was a region that was most intensively cultivated, and\nthere was a great demand for agricultural labourers. But nowhere could\nthe poor find secure jobs.\nEarlier, it was common for labourers to live with landowners. They\nate at the masterís table, and helped their master through the year,\ndoing a variety of odd jobs. By 1800 this practice was disappearing.\nLabourers were being paid wages and employed only during harvest\ntime. As landowners tried to increase their profits, they cut the\nActivity\nWhat happened to the women and children?\nCow keeping, collection of firewood,\ngleaning, gathering of fruits and berries from\nthe common lands was earlier mostly done\nby women and children.\nCan you suggest how enclosures must have\naffected the lives of women and children?\nCan you imagine how the disappearance of\ncommon lands might have changed the\nrelationship between men, women and\nchildren within the family?\n\n-- 133 of 189 --\n\nPeasants and Farmers\n123\nActivity\nSource D\nSource C\nOne peasant who lost his rights to\ncommon land after the enclosures wrote\nto the local lord:\nëShould a poor man take one of your\nsheep from the common, his life would\nbe forfeited by law.

For a very large part of\nthe year the poor had no work.\n1.5 The Introduction of Threshing Machines\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, prices of foodgrains were high and\nfarmers expanded production vigorously. Fearing a shortage of\nlabour, they began buying the new threshing machines that had come\ninto the market.They complained of the insolence of labourers, their\ndrinking habits, and the difficulty of making them work. The\nmachines, they thought, would help them reduce their dependence\non labourers.\nAfter the Napoleonic Wars had ended, thousands of soldiers returned\nto the villages. They needed alternative jobs to survive. But this was\na time when grain from Europe began flowing into England, prices\ndeclined, and an Agricultural Depression set in (see prices in Fig.2).\nAnxious, landowners began reducing the area they cultivated and\ndemanded that the imports of crops be stopped. They tried to cut\nwages and the number of workmen they employed. The unemployed\npoor tramped from village to village, and those with uncertain jobs\nlived in fear of a loss of their livelihood.\nThe Captain Swing riots spread in the countryside at this time. For\nthe poor the threshing machines had become a sign of bad times.\nConclusion\nThe coming of modern agriculture in England thus meant many\ndifferent changes. The open fields disappeared, and the customary\nrights of peasants were undermined. The richer farmers expanded\ngrain production, sold this grain in the world market, made profits,\nand became powerful. The poor left their villages in large numbers.\nSome went from the Midlands to the Southern counties where jobs\nwere available, others to the cities. The income of labourers became\nunstable, their jobs insecure, their livelihood precarious.\n\n-- 134 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n124\nNow let us travel across the Atlantic to the USA. Let us see how\nmodern agriculture developed there, how the USA became the\nbread basket of the world, and what this meant to the rural people\nof America.\nAt the time that common fields were being enclosed in England\nat the end of the eighteenth century, settled agriculture had not\ndeveloped on any extensive scale in the USA. Forests covered over\n800 million acres and grasslands 600 million acres. Fig.5 will give\nyou some idea of what the natural vegetation was like at the time.\n2 Bread Basket and Dust Bowl\nMost of the landscape was not under the control of white Americans.\nTill the 1780s, white American settlements were confined to a small\nnarrow strip of coastal land in the east. If you travelled through the\ncountry at that time you would have met various Native American\ngroups. Several of them were nomadic, some were settled. Many of\nthem lived only by hunting, gathering and fishing; others cultivated\ncorn, beans, tobacco and pumpkin. Still others were expert trappers\nthrough whom European traders had secured their supplies of beaver\nfur since the sixteenth century. In Fig.5 you can see the location of\nthe different tribes in the early eighteenth century.\nFig.5 ñ Forests and grasslands in the\nUSA before the westward expansion of\nwhite settlers.\nAdapted from Baker, 'Agricultural Regions\nof North Americaí, Economic Geography,\nVol.2, 1926 .

White Americans had moved westward and established\ncontrol up to the west coast, displacing local tribes and carving out\nthe entire landscape into different agricultural belts. The USA had\ncome to dominate the world market in agricultural produce. \tHow\ndid this change come about? Who were the new settlers? How did\nthe spread of cultivation shape the lives of the Indian groups who\nhad once lived there?\n2.1 The Westward Move and Wheat Cultivation\nThe story of agrarian expansion is closely connected to the westward\nmovement of the white settlers who took over the land. After the\nAmerican War of Independence from 1775 to 1783 and the formation\nof the United States of America, the white Americans began to move\nwestward. By the time Thomas Jefferson became President of the\nUSA in 1800, over 700,000 white settlers had moved on to the\nAppalachian plateau through the passes. Seen from the east coast,\nAmerica seemed to be a land of promise. Its wilderness could be\nturned into cultivated fields. Forest timber could be cut for export,\nanimals hunted for skin, mountains mined for gold and minerals.\nBut this meant that the American Indians had to be cleared from\nFig.6 ñ The agricultural belts in the USA in 1920.\nAdapted from several essays by Baker published in Economic Geography in the 1920s.\n\n-- 136 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n126\nFig.8 ñ Sod houses in the Frontier.

In the decades after 1800 the US government committed\nitself to a policy of driving the American Indians westward, first\nbeyond the river Mississippi, and then further west. Numerous\nwars were waged in which Indians were massacred and many of\ntheir villages burnt. The Indians resisted, won many victories in\nwars, but were ultimately forced to sign treaties, give up their land\nand move westward.\nAs the Indians retreated, the settlers poured in. They came in\nsuccessive waves. They settled on the Appalachian plateau by the\nfirst decade of the eighteenth century, and then moved into the\nMississippi valley between 1820 and 1850. They slashed and burnt\nforests, pulled out the stumps, cleared the land for cultivation, and\nbuilt log cabins in the forest clearings. Then they cleared larger\nareas, and erected fences around the fields. They ploughed the land\nand sowed corn and wheat.\nIn the early years, the fertile soil produced good crops. When the\nsoil became impoverished and exhausted in one place, the migrants\nwould move further west, to explore new lands and raise a new\ncrop. It was, however, only after the 1860s that settlers swept into\nthe Great Plains across the River Mississippi. In subsequent decades\nthis region became a major wheat-producing area of America.\n1 7 7 5 \t1 8 3 0\n1 8 5 0 \t1 9 2 0\nNew words\nSod ñ Pieces of earth with grass\n\n-- 137 of 189 --\n\nPeasants and Farmers\n127\nLet us follow the story of the wheat farmers in some detail. Let us\nsee how they turned the grasslands into the bread basket of America,\nwhat problems they faced, and what consequences followed.\n2.2 The Wheat Farmers\nFrom the late nineteenth century, there was a dramatic expansion\nof wheat production in the USA. The urban population in the\nUSA was growing and the export market was becoming ever bigger.\nAs the demand increased, wheat prices rose, encouraging farmers\nto produce wheat. The spread of the railways made it easy to\ntransport the grain from the wheat-growing regions to the eastern\ncoast for export. By the early twentieth century the demand became\neven higher, and during the First World War the world market\nboomed. Russian supplies of wheat were cut off and the USA had\nto feed Europe. US President Wilson called upon farmers to\nrespond to the need of the time. ëPlant more wheat, wheat will win\nthe war,í he said.\nIn 1910, about 45 million acres of land in the USA was under wheat.\nNine years later, the area had expanded to 74 million acres, an\nincrease of about 65 per cent. Most of the increase was in the Great\nPlains where new areas were being ploughed to extend cultivation.\nIn many cases, big farmers ñ the wheat barons ñ controlled as much\nas 2,000 to 3,000 acres of land individually.\n2.3 The Coming of New Technology\nThis dramatic expansion was made possible by new technology.\nThrough the nineteenth century, as the settlers moved into new\nhabitats and new lands, they modified their implements to meet\ntheir requirements. When they entered the mid-western prairie,\nthe simple ploughs the farmers had used in the eastern coastal areas\nof the USA proved ineffective. The prairie was covered with a thick\nmat of grass with tough roots. To break the sod and turn the soil\nover, a variety of new ploughs were devised locally, some of them\n12 feet long. Their front rested on small wheels and they were\nhitched on to six yokes of oxen or horses. By the early twentieth\ncentury, farmers in the Great Plains were breaking the ground\nwith tractors and disk ploughs, clearing vast stretches for\nwheat cultivation.\nOnce the crop had ripened it had to be harvested. Before the 1830s,\nthe grain used to be harvested with a cradle or sickle. At harvest\ntime, hundreds of men and women could be seen in the fields\nFig.11 ñ Cyrus McCormick invented the reaper\nin 1831.\nFig.9 ñ A typical farming family on a Sunday\nafternoon.

In1831, Cyrus McCormick invented the first\nmechanical reaper which could cut in one day as much as five\nmen could cut with cradles and 16 men with sickles. By the early\ntwentieth century, most farmers were using combined harvesters\nto cut grain. With one of these machines, 500 acres of wheat could\nbe harvested in two weeks.\nFor the big farmers of the Great Plains these machines had many\nattractions. The prices of wheat were high and the demand seemed\nlimitless. The new machines allowed these big farmers to rapidly\nclear large tracts, break up the soil, remove the grass and prepare\nthe ground for cultivation. \tThe work could be done quickly and\nwith a minimal number of hands. With power-driven machinery,\nfour men could plough, seed and harvest 2,000 to 4,000 acres of\nwheat in a season.\n2.4 What Happened to the Poor?\nFor the poorer farmers, machines brought misery. Many of them\nbought these machines, imagining that wheat prices would remain\nhigh and profits would flow in. If they had no money, the banks\noffered loans. Those who borrowed found it difficult to pay back\ntheir debts. Many of them deserted their farms and looked for\njobs elsewhere.\nBut jobs were difficult to find. Mechanisation had reduced the\nneed for labour. And the boom of the late nineteenth and early\ntwentieth centuries seemed to have come to an end by the mid-\n1920s. After that, most farmers faced trouble. \tProduction had\nexpanded so rapidly during the war and post-war years that that\nthere was a large surplus. Unsold stocks piled up, storehouses\noverflowed with grain, and vast amounts of corn and wheat were\nturned into animal feed. Wheat prices fell and export markets\ncollapsed. This created the grounds for the Great Agrarian\nDepression of the 1930s that ruined wheat farmers everywhere.\n2.5 Dust Bowl\nThe expansion of wheat agriculture in the Great Plains created\nother problems. In the 1930s, terrifying duststorms began to blow\nover the southern plains. Black blizzards rolled in, very often 7,000\nto 8,000 feet high, rising like monstrous waves of muddy water.\nThey came day after day, year after year, through the 1930s. As\n\n-- 140 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n130\nFig.17 ñ Drought Survivors. Painted by Alexander Hogue, (1936).\nHogue dramatised the tragic scenes of death and destruction that he\nsaw, in a series of paintings. Life Magazine referred to Hogue as the\nartist of the dust bowl.\nthe skies darkened, and the dust swept in, people were blinded and\nchoked. Cattle were suffocated to death, their lungs caked with\ndust and mud. Sand buried fences, covered fields, and coated the\nsurfaces of rivers till the fish died. Dead bodies of birds and animals\nwere strewn all over the landscape. Tractors and machines that had\nploughed the earth and harvested the wheat in the 1920s were now\nclogged with dust, damaged beyond repair.\nWhat had gone wrong? Why these duststorms? In part they came\nbecause the early 1930s were years of persistent drought. The rains\nfailed year after year, and temperatures soared. The wind blew with\nferocious speed. But ordinary duststorms became black blizzards\nonly because the entire landscape had been ploughed over, stripped\nof all grass that held it together. When wheat cultivation had\nexpanded dramatically in the early twentieth century, zealous farmers\nhad recklessly uprooted all vegetation, and tractors had turned the\nsoil over, and broken the sod into dust. The whole region had become\na dust bowl. The American dream of a land of plenty had turned\ninto a nightmare. The settlers had thought that they could conquer\nthe entire landscape, turn all land over to growing crops that could\nyield profits. After the 1930s, they realized that they had to respect\nthe ecological conditions of each region.\n\n-- 141 of 189 --\n\nPeasants and Farmers\n131\nLet us now move to India and see what was happening in the Indian\ncountryside in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.\nAs you know, British rule was gradually established in India after the\nBattle of Plassey (1757). Over the period of colonial rule, the rural\nlandscape was radically transformed. The British saw land revenue as a\nmajor source of government income. To build the resources of the state,\nefforts were made to impose a regular system of land revenue, increase\nrevenue rates, and expand the area under cultivation. As cultivation\nexpanded, the area under forests and pastures declined. All this created\nmany problems for peasants and pastoralists. They found their access to\nforests and grazing lands increasingly restricted by rules and regulations.\nAnd they struggled to meet the pressures of government revenue demand.\nIn the colonial period, rural India also came to produce a range of crops\nfor the world market. In the early nineteenth century, indigo and opium\nwere two of the major commercial crops. By the end of the century,\npeasants were producing sugarcane, cotton, jute, wheat and several other\ncrops for export, to feed the population of urban Europe and to supply\nthe mills of Lancashire and Manchester in England.\nHow did Indian cultivators respond to their entry into the modern\nworld of international commerce and trade? Let us look at the history\nof one crop ñ opium ñ to get an idea of what colonial rule meant to\npeasants, and how the market operated in the colonies.\n3.1 A Taste for Tea: The Trade with China\nThe history of opium production in India was linked up with the story\nof British trade with China. In the late eighteenth century, the English\nEast India Company was buying tea and silk from China for sale in\nEngland. As tea became a popular English drink, the tea trade became\nmore and more important. In 1785, about 15 million pounds of tea was\nbeing imported into England. By 1830, the figure had jumped to over\n30 million pounds. In fact, the profits of the East India Company came\nto depend on the tea trade.\nThis created a problem. England at this time produced nothing\nthat could be easily sold in China. The Confucian rulers of China,\nthe Manchus, were suspicious of all foreign merchants. They feared\nthat the merchants would meddle in local politics and disrupt their\n3 The Indian Farmer and Opium Production\n\n-- 142 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n132\nauthority. So the Manchus were unwilling to allow the entry of\nforeign goods.\nIn such a situation, how could Western merchants finance the tea\ntrade? How could they balance their trade? They could buy tea only\nby paying in silver coins or bullion. This meant an outflow of treasure\nfrom England, a prospect that created widespread anxiety. It was\nbelieved that a loss of treasure would impoverish the nation and deplete\nits wealth. Merchants therefore looked for ways to stop this loss of\nsilver. They searched for a commodity they could sell in China,\nsomething they could persuade the Chinese to buy.\nOpium was such a commodity. The Portuguese had introduced\nopium into China in the early sixteenth century. Opium was however,\nknown primarily for its medical properties and used in miniuscule\nquantities for certain types of medicines. The Chinese were aware of\nthe dangers of opium addiction, and the Emperor had forbidden its\nproduction and sale except for medicinal purposes. But Western\nmerchants in the mid-eighteenth century began an illegal trade in\nopium. It was unloaded in a number of sea ports of south-eastern\nChina and carried by local agents to the interiors. By the early 1820s,\nabout 10,000 crates were being annually smuggled into China. Fifteen\nyears later, over 35,000 crates were being unloaded every year.\nWhile the English cultivated a taste for Chinese tea, the Chinese\nbecame addicted to opium. People of all classes took to the drug ñ\nshopkeepers and peddlers, officials and army men, aristocrats and\npaupers. Lin Ze-xu, Special Commissioner at Canton in 1839,\nestimated that there were over 4 million opium smokers in China.\nFig.18 ñ The triangular trade.\nThe British traders took opium from India to\nChina and tea from China to England. Between\nIndia and England trade flowed both ways. By\nthe early 19th century, exports of handlooms\nfrom India declined while the export of raw\nmaterials (silk and cotton) and foodgrains\nincreased. From England, manufactured goods\nflowed into India leading to a decline of Indian\nartisanal production.\nActivity\nOn the arrows in the map indicate the\ncommodities that flowed from one country to\nanother.\n\n-- 143 of 189 --\n\nPeasants and Farmers\n133\nSource E\nIn 1839, the Chinese Emperor sent Lin Ze-xu to Canton as a Special Commissioner\nwith instructions to stop the opium trade. After he arrived in Canton in the spring of\n1839, Lin arrested 1, 600 men involved in the trade, and confiscated 11,000 pounds\nof opium. Then he forced the foreign factories to hand over their stocks of opium,\nburnt 20, 000 crates of opium and blew the ashes to the wind. When he announced\nthat Canton was closed to foreign trade, Britain declared war. Defeated in the Opium\nWar (1837-42) , the Chinese were forced to accept the humiliating terms of the\nsubsequent treaties, legalizing opium trade and opening up China to foreign\nmerchants.\nBefore the war, Lin wrote a strong letter to Queen Victoria criticizing the tr ade in\nopium. Here is an extract from Linís ìLetter of Advice to Queen Victoriaî\nëAll those people in China who sell opium or smoke opium should receive the death\npenalty. We trace the crime of those barbarians who through the y ears have been\nselling opium, then the deep harm they have wrought and the great profit they have\nusurped should fundamentally justify their execution according to law.

As China\nbecame a country of opium addicts, British trade in tea flourished.\nThe returns from opium sale financed the tea purchases in China.\n3.2 Where did Opium come from?\nThis is where the Indian peasants come into the story.\nWhen the British conquered Bengal, they made a determined effort\nto produce opium in the lands under their control. As the market\nfor opium expanded in China, larger volumes of opium flowed out\nof Bengal ports. Before 1767, no more than 500 chests (of two\nmaunds each) were being exported from India. Within four years,\nthe quantity trebled. A hundred years later, in 1870, the government\nwas exporting about 50,000 chests annually.\nSupplies had to be increased to feed this booming export trade. But\nthis was not easy. How could the cultivators be persuaded to grow\nopium? For a variety of reasons, they were unwilling to turn their\nfields over to poppy. First, the crop had to be grown on the best\nland, on fields that lay near villages and were well manured. On this\nland peasants usually produced pulses. If they planted opium on this\nland, then pulses could not be grown there, or they would have to\nbe grown on inferior land where harvests were poorer and uncertain.\nSecond, many cultivators owned no land. To cultivate, they had to\npay rent and lease land from landlords. And the rent charged on\ngood lands near villages was very high. Third, the cultivation of opium\nwas a difficult process. The plant was delicate, and cultivators had to\nspend long hours nurturing it. This meant that they did not have\nenough time to care for other crops. Finally, the price the government\npaid to the cultivators for the opium they produced was very low. It\nwas unprofitable for cultivators to grow opium at that price.\n3.3 How Were Unwilling Cultivators Made to Produce Opium?\nUnwilling cultivators were made to produce opium through a system\nof advances. In the rural areas of Bengal and Bihar, there were large\nnumbers of poor peasants. They never had enough to survive. It was\ndifficult for them to pay rent to the landlord or to buy food and\nclothing. From the 1780s, such peasants found their village headmen\n(mahato) giving them money advances to produce opium. \tWhen\noffered a loan, the cultivators were tempted to accept, hoping to\n\n-- 145 of 189 --\n\nPeasants and Farmers\n135\nSource F\nThe Deputy Opium Agent of Allahabad\nwrote in 1833:\nëThe Board appears \tto think that the\ncultivators are not unwilling to cultivate.\nFor two years past I have had constant\ncommunications with the cultivators in\nsome of the districts south of the Jumna\nand state positively the people are\ndiscontented and dissatisfied almost to\na man. I have made many enquires on\nthe subject and the impression left on\nmy mind is that cultivation of the poppy\nis considered a curse by the people and\nthat only by undue authority is it upheld\nÖ The cultivation was introduced at the\nrequest, nay I may say, at the command\nof the Collector; Ö The people tell me,\nthey are ill used and abused and even\nbeaten by the chuprassies Ö The people\nalmost uniformly told, they suffered loss\nfrom poppy Öí\nFrom Benoy Chowdhury, Growth of\nCommercial Agriculture in Bengal.\nmeet their immediate needs and pay back the loan at a later stage.\nBut the loan tied the peasant to the headman and through him to the\ngovernment. It was the government opium agents who were advancing\nthe money to the headmen, who in turn gave it to the cultivators. By\ntaking the loan, the cultivator was forced to grow opium on a specified\narea of land and hand over the produce to the agents once the crop\nhad been harvested. He had no option of planting the field with a\ncrop of his choice or of selling his produce to anyone but the\ngovernment agent. And he had to accept the low price offered for\nthe produce.\nThe problem could have been partly solved by increasing the price\nof opium. But the government was reluctant to do so. It wanted to\nproduce opium at a cheap rate and sell it at a high price to opium\nagents in Calcutta, who then shipped it to China. This difference\nbetween the buying and selling price was the governmentís opium\nrevenue. The prices given to the peasants were so low that by the\nearly eighteenth century angry peasants began agitating for higher\nprices and refused to take advances. In regions around Benaras,\ncultivators began giving up opium cultivation. They produced\nsugarcane and potatoes instead. Many cultivators sold off their crop\nto travelling traders (pykars) who offered higher prices.\nBy 1773, the British government in Bengal had established a\nmonopoly to trade in opium. No one else was legally permitted to\ntrade in the product. By the 1820s, the British found to their horror\nthat opium production in their territories was rapidly declining, but\nits production outside the British territories was increasing. \tIt was\nbeing produced in Central India and Rajasthan, within princely states\nthat were not under British control. In these regions, local traders\nwere offering much higher prices to peasants and exporting opium\nto China. In fact, armed bands of traders were found carrying on\nthe trade in the 1820s. To the British this trade was illegal: \tit was\nsmuggling and it had to be stopped. Government monopoly had to\nbe retained. It therefore instructed its agents posted in the princely\nstates to confiscate all opium and destroy the crops.\nThis conflict between the British government, peasants and local\ntraders continued as long as opium production lasted.\nWe should not however, think that the experiences of all peasants in\ncolonial India were like those of the opium cultivators. We will read\nabout other experiences of peasants in colonial India in a later chapter.\n\n-- 146 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n136\nConclusion\nIn this chapter you saw how rural areas in different parts of the\nworld changed in the modern period.

Nor was the history of modernisation simply a\nglorious story of growth and development. It was also a story of\ndisplacements and impoverishment, ecological crises and social\nrebellion, colonisation and repression.

In this section you will\nread about the history of sports and clothing.\nHistory is not just about the dramatic events in the world. It is equally about the\nsmall things in our lives. Everything around us has a history ñ the clothes we wear,\nthe food we eat, the music we hear, the medicines we use, the literature we read, the\ngames we play. All these have evolved over time. Since we relate to them in our daily\nlives, their history escapes us. We never pause to think what \tthings were like a\ncentury ago; or how people in different societies see these everyday things ñ food\nand clothing for instance ñ differently.\nChapter VII is on History and Sports. You will study this history through the story\nof one game that in India has captured the imagination of the nation for some decades.\nNews of cricket today hits the headline of newspapers. Cricket matches are organised\nto establish friendship between nations and cricketers are seen as ambassadors of the\ncountry. The game has, in fact, come to represent the unity of India. But did you\nknow that this was not always so? This chapter will tell you about the long and\nchequered history of the game.\nAt one time, a century and half ago, cricket was an English game. It had been invented\nin England and became intimately linked to the culture of nineteenth century\nVictorian society. The game was expected to represent all that the English valued ñ\nfair play, discipline, gentlemanliness. It was introduced in schools as part of a wider\nprogramme of physical training through which boys were to be moulded into ideal\ncitizens. Girls were not to play games meant for boys. With the British, cricket\nspread to the colonies. There again it was supposed to uphold the values of Englishness.\nEVERYDAY LIFE, CULTURE AND POLITICS\nEVERYDAY LIFE, CULTURE AND POLITICS\n\n-- 150 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n140\nThe colonial masters assumed that only they could play the game as it ought to be\nplayed, in its true spirit. They were, in fact, \tworried when the inhabitants of the\ncolonies not only began to play the game, but often played it better than the masters;\nand at times beat the English at their own game. The game of cricket thus got linked up\nclosely with the politics of colonialism and nationalism.\nWithin the colonies the game had a complex history. As Chapter VII will show, it was\nconnected to the politics of caste and region, community and nation. The emergence of\ncricket as a national game was the result of many decades of historical development.\nFrom cricket you will move to clothing (Chapter VIII). You will see how a history of\nclothing can tell us so much about the history of societies. The clothes people wear are\nshaped by the rules and norms of societies. They reflect peopleís sense of beauty and\nhonour, their notions of proper conduct and behavior. As societies change, these norms\nalter. But these changes in the norms of society and styles of clothing come about as a\nconsequence of long years of struggle. They have a history. They do not just\nhappen naturally.\nChapter VIII will introduce you to this history. It will show how the shifts in clothing\nin England and India were shaped by the social movements within these societies, and\nby changes within the economy. You will see how clothing too, is deeply connected to\nthe politics of colonialism and nationalism, caste and class. A look at the history of\nclothing helps us discover new layers of meaning in the politics of Swadeshi and the\nsymbol of the charkha. It even helps us understand Mahatma Gandhi better, for he was\none individual who was highly sensitive to the politics of clothing, and wrote\nextensively on it.\nOnce you see the history behind one or two such issues, you may begin to ask historical\nquestions about other such aspects of ordinary life which you have taken for granted.\n\n-- 151 of 189 --\n\nHistory and Sport: The Story of Cricket\n141\nCricket grew out of the many stick-and-ball games played in England\n500 years ago, under a variety of different rules. The word ëbatí is an old\nEnglish word that simply means stick or club. By the seventeenth century,\ncricket had evolved enough to be recognisable as a distinct game and it\nwas popular enough for its fans to be fined for playing it on Sunday\ninstead of going to church. Till the middle of the eighteenth century, bats\nwere roughly the same shape as hockey sticks, curving outwards at the\nbottom. There was a simple reason for this: the ball was bowled underarm,\nalong the ground and the curve at the end of the bat gave the batsman\nthe best chance of making contact.\nHow that early version of cricket played in village England grew into\nthe modern game played in giant stadiums in great cities is a proper\nsubject for history because one of the uses of history is to understand\nhow the present was made. And sport is a large part of contemporary\nlife: it is one way in which we amuse ourselves, compete with each\nother, stay fit, and express our social loyalties. If tens of millions of\nIndians today drop everything to watch the Indian team play a Test\nmatch or a one-day international, it is reasonable for a history of India\nto explore how that stick-and-ball game invented in south-eastern\nEngland became the ruling passion of the Indian sub-continent. This\nis particularly so, since the game was linked to the wider history of\ncolonialism and nationalism and was in part shaped by the politics of\nreligion and caste.\nOur history of cricket will look first at the\nevolution of cricket as a game in England,\nand discuss the wider culture of physical\ntraining and athleticism of the time. It will\nthen move to India, discuss the history of\nthe adoption of cricket in this country, and\ntrace the modern transformation of the\ngame. In each of these sections we will see\nhow the history of the game was connected\nto the social history of the time.\nHistory\n \nand\n \nSport:\n \nThe\n \nStory\n \nof Cricket\nHistory and Sport:\tHistory and Sport:\tHistory and Sport:\tHistory and Sport:\tHistory and Sport:\nThe Story of Cricket\tThe Story of Cricket\tThe Story of Cricket\tThe Story of Cricket\tThe Story of Cricket\nFig.1 ñ The oldest cricket bat in existence.\nNote the curved end, similar to a hockey\nstick.\nFig.2 ó An artistís sketch of the cricket ground at Lordís in England\nin 1821.\nChapter V\nII\n\n-- 152 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n142\nThe social and economic history of England in the eighteenth and\nnineteenth centuries, cricketís early years, shaped the game and gave\ncricket its unique nature.\nFor example, one of the peculiarities of Test cricket is that a match\ncan go on for five days and still end in a draw. No other modern\nteam sport takes even half as much time to complete. A football\nmatch is generally over in an hour-and-a-half of playing time. Even\nbaseball, a long-drawn-out bat-and-ball game by the standards of\nmodern sport, completes nine innings in less than half the time that\nit takes to play a limited-overs match, the shortened version of\nmodern cricket!\nAnother curious characteristic of cricket is that the length of the\npitch is specified ñ 22 yards ñ but the size or shape of the ground is\nnot. Most other team sports, such as hockey and football lay down\nthe dimensions of the playing area: cricket does not. Grounds can be\noval like the Adelaide Oval or nearly circular, like Chepauk in\nChennai. A six at the Melbourne Cricket Ground needs to clear\nmuch more ground than a lofted shot for the same reward at Feroz\nShah Kotla in Delhi.\nThereís a historical reason behind both these oddities. Cricket was\nthe earliest modern team sport to be codified, which is another way\nof saying that cricket gave itself rules and regulations so that it could\nbe played in a uniform and standardised way\nwell before team games like soccer and hockey.\nThe first written ëLaws of Cricketí were drawn\nup in 1744. They stated, ëthe principals shall\nchoose from amongst the gentlemen present two\numpires who shall absolutely decide all disputes.\nThe stumps must be 22 inches high and the bail\nacross them six inches. The ball must be between\n5 and 6 ounces, and the two sets of stumps 22\nyards apartí. There were no limits on the shape\nor size of the bat. It appears that 40 notches or\nruns was viewed as a very big score, probably\ndue to the bowlers bowling quickly at shins\nunprotected by pads.

In\n1788, the MCC published its first revision of the laws and became\nthe guardian of cricketís regulations.\nThe MCCís revision of the laws brought in a series of changes in\nthe game that occurred in the second half of the eighteenth century.\nDuring the 1760s and 1770s it became common to pitch the ball\nthrough the air, rather than roll it along the ground. This change\ngave bowlers the options of length, deception through the air, plus\nincreased pace. It also opened new possibilities for spin and swing.\nIn response, batsmen had to master timing and shot selection. One\nimmediate result was the replacement of the curved bat with the\nstraight one. All of this raised the premium on skill and reduced\nthe influence of rough ground and brute force.\nThe weight of the ball was limited to between 5Ω to 5æ ounces,\nand the width of the bat to four inches. The latter ruling followed\nan innings by a batsman who appeared with a bat as wide as the\nwicket! In 1774, the first leg-before law was published. Also around\nthis time, a third stump became common. By 1780, three days had\nbecome the length of a major match, and this year also saw the\ncreation of the first six-seam cricket ball.\nWhile many important changes occurred during the nineteenth\ncentury (the rule about wide balls was applied, the exact\ncircumference of the ball was specified, protective equipment like\npads and gloves became available, boundaries were introduced where\npreviously all shots had to be run and, most importantly, over-\narm bowling became legal) cricket remained a pre-industrial sport\nthat matured during the early phase of the Industrial Revolution,\nthe late eighteenth century. This history has made cricket a game\nwith characteristics of both the past and the present day.\nCricketís connection with a rural past can be seen in the length of\na Test match. Originally, cricket matches had no time limit. The\ngame went on for as long as it took to bowl out a side twice. The\nrhythms of village life were slower and cricketís rules were made\nbefore the Industrial Revolution. Modern factory work meant that\npeople were paid by the hour or the day or the week: games that\nwere codified after the industrial revolution, like football and\nhockey, were strictly time-limited to fit the routines of industrial\ncity life.\nIn the same way, cricketís vagueness about the size of a cricket\nground is a result of its village origins. Cricket was originally played\nNew words\nCodified ñ Made into a formalised system\nwith clearly established rules and laws\nFig.4 ñ The laws of cricket drawn up and\nrevised by the MCC were regularly published in\nthis form. Note that norms of betting were also\nformalised.\n\n-- 154 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n144\non country commons, unfenced land that was public property.\nThe size of the commons varied from one village to another, so\nthere were no designated boundaries or boundary hits. When the\nball went into the crowd, the crowd cleared a way for the fieldsman\nto retrieve it. Even after boundaries were written into the laws of\ncricket, their distance from the wicket was not specified. The laws\nsimply lay down that ëthe umpire shall agree with both captains on\nthe boundaries of the playing areaí.\nIf you look at the gameís equipment, you can see how cricket both\nchanged with changing times and yet fundamentally remained true to\nits origins in rural England. Cricketís most important tools are all made\nof natural, pre-industrial materials. The bat is made of wood as are\nthe stumps and the bails. The ball is made with leather, twine and\ncork. Even today both bat and ball are handmade, not industrially\nmanufactured. The material of the bat changed slightly over time. Once\nit was cut out of a single piece of wood. Now it consists of two pieces,\nthe blade which is made out of the wood of the willow tree and the\nhandle which is made out of cane that became available as European\ncolonialists and trading companies established themselves in Asia.\nUnlike golf and tennis, cricket has refused to remake its tools with\nindustrial or man-made materials: plastic, fibre glass and metal have\nbeen firmly rejected. Australian cricketer Dennis Lillee tried to play an\ninnings with an aluminium bat, only to have it outlawed by the umpires.\nBut in the matter of protective equipment, cricket has been influenced\nby technological change. The invention of vulcanised rubber led to\nthe introduction of pads in 1848 and protective gloves soon afterwards,\nand the modern game would be unimaginable without helmets made\nout of metal and synthetic lightweight materials.\nFig.5 ñ This poster announces a match at\nLordís in 1848.\nIt shows the difference between the amateurs\nand the professionals by calling the two sides\nthe Gentlemen and the Players.\nAdvertisements for nineteenth century\nmatches looked like theatre posters suggesting\nthe dramatic nature of the game.\nFig.6 ñ The legendary batsman W.G.

The rich who could afford to play it for pleasure were called\namateurs and the poor who played it for a living were called\nprofessionals. The rich were amateurs for two reasons. One, they\nconsidered sport a kind of leisure. To play for the pleasure of playing\nand not for money was an aristocratic value. Two, there was not\nenough money in the game for the rich to be interested. The wages\nof professionals were paid by patronage or subscription or gate\nmoney. The game was seasonal and did not offer employment the\nyear round. Most professionals worked as miners or in other forms\nof working class employment in winter, the off-season.\nThe social superiority of amateurs was built into the customs of\ncricket. Amateurs were called Gentlemen while professionals had to\nbe content with being described as Players. They even entered the\nground from different entrances. Amateurs tended to be batsmen,\nNew words\nPatronage \tñ \tAgreement \tby \twealthy\nsupporter to give financial support for a\nspecific cause\nSubscription \tñ \tCollected \tfinancial\ncontribution for a specific purpose (such as\ncricket)\nThomas Hughes (1822-1896) studied at Rugby School during the headmastership of Thomas Arnold.\nBased on his school experience, he wrote a novel, Tom Brownís Schooldays. The book, published in 1857,\nbecame popular and helped spread the ideas of what came to be called muscular Christianity that believed\nthat healthy citizens had to be moulded through Christian ideals and sports.\nIn this book Tom Brown is transformed from a nervous, homesick, timid boy into a robust, manly student.\nHe becomes a heroic figure recognised for his physical courage, sportsmanship, loyalty and patriotism.\nThis transformation is brought about by the discipline of the public school and the culture of sports.\nóóEXTRACTóó\nëCome, none of your irony, Brown,í answers the master. ëIím beginning to understand the game scientifically.\nWhat a noble game it is, too!í\nëIsnít it?

That is partly why the laws of the\ngame always give the benefit of the doubt to the batsman. Cricket is\na batsmanís game because its rules were made to favour ëGentlemení,\nwho did most of the batting. The social superiority of the amateur\nwas also the reason the captain of a cricket team was traditionally a\nbatsman: not because batsmen were naturally better captains but\nbecause they were generally Gentlemen. Captains of teams, whether\nclub teams or national sides, were always amateurs. It was not till the\n1930s that the English Test team was led by a professional, the\nYorkshire batsman, Len Hutton.\nItís often said that the ëbattle of Waterloo was won on the playing\nfields of Etoní. This means that Britainís military success was based\non the values taught to schoolboys in its public schools. Eton was\nthe most famous of these schools. The English boarding school was\nthe institution that trained English boys for careers in the military,\nthe civil service and the church, the three great institutions of imperial\nEngland. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, men like\nThomas Arnold, headmaster of the famous Rugby School and\nfounder of the modern public school system, saw team sport like\ncricket and rugby not just as outdoor play, but as an organised way\nof teaching English boys the discipline, the importance of hierarchy,\nthe skills, the codes of honour and the leadership qualities that helped\nthem build and run the British empire. Victorian empire builders\njustified the conquest of other countries as an act of unselfish social\nservice, by which backward peoples were introduced to the civilising\ninfluence of British law and Western knowledge. Cricket helped to\nconfirm this self-image of the English elite by glorifying the amateur\nideal, where cricket was played not for victory or profit, but for its\nown sake, in the spirit of fair play.\nIn actual fact the Napoleonic wars were won because of the economic\ncontribution of the iron works of Scotland and Wales, the mills of\nLancashire and the financial houses of the City of London. It was\nthe English lead in trade and industry that made Britain the worldís\ngreatest power, but it suited the English ruling class to believe that it\nwas the superior character of its young men, built in boarding schools,\nplaying gentlemanly games like cricket, that tipped the balance.\nNew words\nHierarchy ñ Organised by rank and status\nFig.7 ñ A cricket match at Lordís between the\nfamous public schools Eton and Harrow.\nWhile the game itself would look similar\nwherever it is played, the crowd does not.\nNotice how the upper-class social character\nof the game is brought out by the focus on\ngentlemen in bowler hats and ladies with their\nparasols shading them from the sun.\nFrom Illustrated London News,\nJuly 20 1872.\n\n-- 157 of 189 --\n\nHistory and Sport: The Story of Cricket\n147\nActivity\nSource B\nSport for girls?\nTill the last part of the nineteenth century, sports and vigorous\nexercise for girls was not a part of their education.

The pre-industrial oddness of cricket made it a hard game\nto export. It took root only in countries that the British conquered and\nruled. In these colonies, cricket was established as a popular sport either\nby white settlers (as in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Australia, New Zealand,\nthe West Indies and Kenya) or by local elites who wanted to copy the\nhabits of their colonial masters, as in India.\nWhile British imperial officials brought the\ngame to the colonies, they made little effort\nto spread the game, especially in colonial\nterritories where the subjects of empire were\nmainly non-white, such as India and the\nWest Indies. Here, playing cricket became a\nsign of superior social and racial status, and\nthe \tAfro-Caribbean \tpopulation \twas\ndiscouraged from participating in organised\nclub cricket, which remained dominated by\nwhite plantation owners and their servants.\nThe first non-white club in the West Indies\nwas established towards the end of the\nnineteenth century, and even in this case its\nmembers were light-skinned mulattos.

Success at cricket became a measure\nof racial equality and political progress. At the time\nof their independence many of the political leaders\nof Caribbean countries like Forbes Burnham and\nEric Williams saw in the game a chance for self-\nrespect and international standing. When the West\nIndies won its first Test series against England in\n1950, it was celebrated as a national achievement, as\na way of demonstrating that West Indians were the\nequals of white Englishmen. There were two ironies to this great\nvictory. One, the West Indian team that won was captained by a\nwhite player. The first time a black player led the West Indies Test\nteam was in 1960 when Frank Worrell was named captain. And two,\nthe West Indies cricket team represented not one nation but several\ndominions that later became independent countries. The pan-West\nIndian team that represents the Caribbean region in international\nTest cricket is the only exception to a series of unsuccessful efforts to\nbring about West Indian unification.\nCricket fans know that watching a match involves taking sides. In a\nRanji Trophy match when Delhi plays Mumbai, the loyalty of\nspectators depends on which city they come from or support. When\nIndia plays Australia, the spectators watching the match on television\nin Bhopal or Chennai feel involved as Indians ñ they are moved by\nnationalist loyalties. But through the early history of Indian first-\nclass cricket, teams were not organised on geographical principles\nand it was not till 1932 that a national team was given the right to\nrepresent India in a Test match. So how were teams organised and,\nin the absence of regional or national teams, how did cricket fans\nchoose sides? We turn to history for answers, to discover how cricket\nin India developed and to get a sense of the loyalties that united and\ndivided Indians in the days of the Raj.\n2.1 Cricket, Race and Religion\nCricket in colonial India was organised on the principle of race and\nreligion.

The first Indian club, the Calcutta Cricket Club, was\nestablished in 1792. Through the eighteenth century, cricket in India\nwas almost wholly a sport played by British military men and civil\nservants in all-white clubs and gymkhanas. Playing cricket in the\nprivacy of these clubs was more than just fun: it was also an escape\nfrom the strangeness, discomfort and danger of their stay in India.\nIndians were considered to have no talent for the game and certainly\nnot meant to play it. But they did.\nThe origins of Indian cricket, that is, cricket played by Indians are to\nbe found in Bombay and the first Indian community to start playing\nthe game was the small community of Zoroastrians, the Parsis.\nBrought into close contact with the British because of their interest\nin trade and the first Indian community to westernise, the Parsis\nfounded the first Indian cricket club, the Oriental Cricket Club in\nBombay in 1848. Parsi clubs were funded and sponsored by Parsi\nbusinessmen like the Tatas and the Wadias. The white cricket elite in\nIndia offered no help to the enthusiastic Parsis. In fact, there was a\nquarrel between the Bombay Gymkhana, a whites-only club, and\nParsi cricketers over the use of a public park. The Parsis complained\nthat the park was left unfit for cricket because the polo ponies of the\nBombay Gymkhana dug up the surface.\nWhen it became clear that the colonial\nauthorities were prejudiced in favour of\ntheir white compatriots, the Parsis built\ntheir own gymkhana to play cricket in.\nThe rivalry between the Parsis and the\nracist Bombay Gymkhana had a happy\nending for these pioneers of Indian cricket.\nA Parsi team beat the Bombay Gymkhana\nat cricket in 1889, just four years after the\nfoundation of the Indian National\nCongress in 1885, an organisation that was\nlucky to have amongst its early leaders the\ngreat Parsi statesman and intellectual\nDadabhai Naoroji.\nThe establishment of the Parsi Gymkhana became a precedent for\nother Indians who in turn established clubs based on the idea of\nreligious community. By the 1890s, Hindus and Muslims were busy\ngathering funds and support for a Hindu Gymkhana and an Islam\nGymkhana. The British did not consider colonial India as a nation.\nThey saw it as a collection of castes and races and religious\ncommunities and gave themselves the credit for unifying the sub-\nNew word\nPrecedent ñ Previous action which\nprovides reason to repeat it\nFig.13 ñ The Parsi team, the first Indian cricket team to tour England\nin 1886.\nNote that along with the traditional cricket flannels, they wear Parsi caps.\n\n-- 161 of 189 --\n\nHistory and Sport: The Story of Cricket\n151\ncontinent. In the late nineteenth century, many Indian institutions\nand movements were organised around the idea of religious\ncommunity because the colonial state encouraged these divisions and\nwas quick to recognise communal institutions. For example, the\nGovernor of the Bombay Presidency while dealing with an\napplication from the Islam Gymkhana for land on Bombayís seafront\nwrote: ëÖ we can be certain that in a short time we shall get a similar\napplication from some Hindu Gymkhana Ö I donít see how we are\nto refuse these applicants; but I will Ö refuse any more grants once a\nGymkhana has been established Ö by each nationalityí. (emphasis\nadded). It is obvious from this letter that colonial officials regarded\nreligious communities as separate nationalities. Applications that used\nthe communal categories favoured by the colonial state were, as this\nletter shows, more likely to be approved.\nThis history of gymkhana cricket led to first-class cricket being\norganised on communal and racial lines. The teams that played\ncolonial Indiaís greatest and most famous first-class cricket tournament\ndid not represent regions, as teams in todayís Ranji Trophy currently\ndo, but religious communities. The tournament was initially called\nthe Quadrangular, because it was played by four teams: the\nEuropeans, the Parsis, the Hindus and the Muslims. It later became\nthe Pentangular when a fifth team was added, namely, the Rest, which\ncomprised all the communities left over, such as the Indian Christians.\nFor example, Vijay Hazare, a Christian, played for the Rest.\nBy the late 1930s and early 1940s, journalists, cricketers and political\nleaders had begun to criticize the racial and communal foundations\nof the Pentangular tournament. The distinguished editor of the\nnewspaper the Bombay Chronicle, S.A. Brelvi, the famous radio\ncommentator A.F.S. Talyarkhan and Indiaís most respected political\nfigure, Mahatma Gandhi, condemned the Pentangular as a\ncommunally divisive competition that was out of place in a time\nwhen nationalists were trying to unite Indiaís diverse population. A\nrival first-class tournament on regional lines, the National Cricket\nChampionship (later named the Ranji Trophy), was established but\nnot until Independence did it properly replace the Pentangular. The\ncolonial state and its divisive conception of India was the rock on\nwhich the Pentangular was built. It was a colonial tournament and it\ndied with the Raj.\nBox 1\nCaste and cricket\nPalwankar Baloo was born in Poona in\n1875.

This was possible because Test\ncricket from its origins in 1877 was organised as a contest between\ndifferent parts of the British empire, not sovereign nations. The first\nTest was played between England and Australia when Australia was still\na white settler colony, not even a self-governing dominion. Similarly,\nthe small countries of the Caribbean that together make up the West\nIndies team were British colonies till well after the Second World War.\n3.1 Decolonisation and Sport\nDecolonisation, or the process through which different parts of European\nempires became independent nations, began with the independence of\nIndia in 1947 and continued for the next half a century. This process led\nto the decline of British influence in trade, commerce, military affairs,\ninternational politics and, inevitably, sporting matters. But this did not\nhappen at once; it took a while for the relative unimportance of post-\nimperial Britain to be reflected in the organisation of world cricket.\nEven after Indian independence kick-started the disappearance of the\nBritish empire, the regulation of international cricket remained the\nbusiness of the Imperial Cricket Conference ICC. The ICC, renamed the\nInternational Cricket Conference as late as 1965, was dominated by its\nfoundation members, England and Australia, which retained the right\nof veto over its proceedings. Not till 1989 was the privileged position of\nEngland and Australia scrapped in favour of equal membership.\nThe colonial flavour of world cricket during the 1950s and 1960s can be\nseen from the fact that England and the other white commonwealth\ncountries, Australia and New Zealand, continued to play Test cricket\nwith South Africa, a racist state that practised a policy of racial\nsegregation which, among other things, barred non-whites (who made\nup the majority of South Africaís population) from representing that\ncountry in Test matches. Test-playing nations like India, Pakistan and\nthe West Indies boycotted South Africa, but they did not have the\nnecessary power in the ICC to debar that country from Test cricket.\nThat only came to pass when the political pressure to isolate South\nAfrica applied by the newly decolonised nations of Asia and Africa\ncombined with liberal feeling in Britain and forced the English cricket\nauthorities to cancel a tour by South Africa in 1970.\nNew words\nSegregation ñ Separation (of people) on the\nbasis of colour or race\n\n-- 164 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n154\nThe 1970s were the decade in which cricket was transformed: it was a\ntime when a traditional game evolved to fit a changing world. If 1970\nwas notable for the exclusion of South Africa from international cricket,\n1971 was a landmark year because the first one-day international was\nplayed between England and Australia in Melbourne. The enormous\npopularity of this shortened version of the game led to the first World\nCup being successfully staged in 1975. Then in 1977, even as cricket\ncelebrated 100 years of Test matches, the game was changed forever, not\nby a player or cricket administrator, but by a businessman.\nKerry Packer, an Australian television tycoon who saw the money-\nmaking potential of cricket as a televised sport, signed up fifty-one of\nthe worldís leading cricketers against the wishes of the national cricket\nboards and for about two years staged unofficial Tests and One-Day\ninternationals under the name of World Series Cricket. While Packerís\nëcircusí as it was then described folded up after two years, the\ninnovations he introduced during this time to make cricket more\nattractive to television audiences endured and changed the nature of\nthe game.\nColoured dress, protective helmets, field restrictions, cricket under\nlights, became a standard part of the post-Packer game. Crucially, Packer\ndrove home the lesson that cricket was a marketable game, which could\ngenerate huge revenues. Cricket boards became rich by selling television\nrights to television companies. Television channels made money by\nselling television spots to companies who were happy to pay large\nsums of money to air commercials for their products to cricketís captive\ntelevision audience. Continuous television coverage made cricketers\ncelebrities who, besides being paid better by their cricket boards, now\nmade even larger sums of money by making commercials for a wide\nrange of products, from tyres to colas, on television.\nTelevision coverage changed cricket. It expanded the audience for the\ngame by beaming cricket into small towns and villages. It also broadened\ncricketís social base. Children who had never previously had the chance\nto watch international cricket because they lived outside the big cities,\nwhere top-level cricket was played, could now watch and learn by imitating\ntheir heroes.\nThe technology of satellite television and the world wide reach of\nmulti-national television companies created a global market for cricket.\n4 Commerce, Media and Cricket\t4 Commerce, Media and Cricket\t4 Commerce, Media and Cricket\t4 Commerce, Media and Cricket\t4 Commerce, Media and Cricket T\tT\tT\tT\tToday\today\today\today\today\n\n-- 165 of 189 --\n\nHistory and Sport: The Story of Cricket\n155\nMatches in Sydney could now be watched live in Surat. This simple\nfact shifted the balance of power in cricket: a process that had been\nbegun by the break-up of the British Empire was taken to its logical\nconclusion by globalisation. Since India had the largest viewership\nfor the game amongst the cricket-playing nations and the largest\nmarket in the cricketing world, the gameís centre of gravity shifted\nto South Asia. This shift was symbolized by the shifting of the ICC\nheadquarters from London to tax-free Dubai.\nA more important sign that the centre of gravity in cricket has shifted\naway from the old, Anglo-Australian axis is that innovations in cricket\ntechnique in recent years have mainly come from the practice of sub-\ncontinental teams in countries like India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.\nPakistan has pioneered two great advances in bowling: the doosra and\nthe ëreverse swingí. Both skills were developed in response to sub-\ncontinental conditions: the doosra to counter aggressive batsmen with\nheavy modern bats who were threatening to make finger-spin\nobsolete and ëreverse swingí to move the ball in on dusty, unresponsive\nwickets under clear skies. Initially, both innovations were greeted\nwith great suspicion by countries like Britain and Australia which\nsaw them as an underhanded, illegal bending of the laws of cricket.\nIn time, it came to be accepted that the laws of cricket could not\ncontinue to be framed for British or Australian conditions of play,\nand they became part of the technique of all bowlers, everywhere in\nthe world.\nOne hundred and fifty years ago the first Indian cricketers, the Parsis,\nhad to struggle to find an open space to play in. Today, the global\nmarketplace has made Indian players the best-paid, most famous\ncricketers in the game, men for whom the world is a stage. The\nhistory that brought about this transformation was made up of many\nsmaller changes: the replacement of the gentlemanly amateur by the\npaid professional, the triumph of the one-day game as it\novershadowed Test cricket in terms of popularity, and the remarkable\nchanges in global commerce and technology.

Amongst its sporting ancestors, hockey can count the\nScottish game called shinty, the English and Welsh game called bandy and Irish hurling.\nHockey, like many other modern games, was introduced into India by the British army in colonial times. The first hockey club\nin India was started in Calcutta in 1885-1886. India was represented in the hockey competition of the Olympic Games for the\nfirst time in 1928. India reached the finals defeating Austria, Belgium, Denmark and Switzerland. In the finals, India defeated\nHolland by three goals to nil.\nThe brilliance and skill of players like the great Dhyan Chand brought India a string of Olympic gold medals. Between 1928\nand 1956, India won gold medals in six consecutive Olympic Games. During this golden age of Indian dominance, India\nplayed 24 Olympic matches, and won them all, scored 178 goals (at an average of 7.43 goals per match) and conceded only\nseven goals. The two other gold medals for India came in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics and the 1980 Moscow Olympics.\nPolo was greatly favoured as a game suitable for military and athletic young men. Following one of the earliest games in\nEngland, a report in the Illustrated London News declared:\nëAs an exercise Ö for military men this bold and graceful sport is likely to give increased dexterity in the use of the lance\nor sabre, or other cavalry weapons, as well as a firmer seat in the saddle, and a faculty of quickly turning to the right hand\nor to the left, which must be effective in the melee of battle.í\nFrom: Illustrated London News, 1872.\nFig.15 ñ Polo was a game invented by\ncolonial officials in India and soon gained\ngreat popularity.

All\nsocieties observe certain rules, some of them quite strict, about the\nway in which men, women and children should dress, or how\ndifferent social classes and groups should present themselves. These\nnorms come to define the identity of people, the way they see\nthemselves, the way they want others to see them. They shape our\nnotions of grace and beauty, ideas of modesty and shame. As times\nchange and societies are transformed, these notions also alter.\nModifications in clothing come to reflect these changes.\nThe emergence of the modern world is marked by dramatic changes\nin clothing. In this chapter, we will look at some of the histories of\nclothing in the modern period, that is in the nineteenth and\ntwentieth centuries.\nWhy are these two centuries important?\nBefore the age of democratic revolutions and the development of\ncapitalist markets in eighteenth-century Europe, most people dressed\naccording to their regional codes, and were limited by the types of\nclothes and the cost of materials that were available in their region.\nClothing styles were also strictly regulated by class, gender or status\nin the social hierarchy.\nAfter the eighteenth century, the colonisation of most of the world\nby Europe, the spread of democratic ideals and the growth of an\nindustrial society, completely changed the ways in which people\nthought about dress and its meanings. People could use styles and\nmaterials that were drawn from other cultures and locations, and\nwestern dress styles for men were adopted worldwide.\nIn Chapter I you have seen how the French Revolution transformed\nmany aspects of social and political life. The revolution also swept\naway existing dress codes, known as the sumptuary laws. Let us\nlook briefly at what these laws were.\nClothing:\n \nA Social\n \nHistory\n \nChapter V\nIII\n© NCERT\nnot to be republished\n\n-- 170 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n160\nIn medieval Europe, dress codes were sometimes imposed upon\nmembers of different layers of society through actual laws which\nwere spelt out in some detail. From about 1294 to the time of the\nFrench Revolution in 1789, the people of France were expected to\nstrictly follow what were known as ‘sumptuary laws.’ The laws tried\nto control the behaviour of those considered social inferiors,\npreventing them from wearing certain clothes, consuming certain\nfoods and beverages (usually this referred to alcohol) and hunting\ngame in certain areas. In medieval France, the items of clothing a\nperson could purchase per year was regulated, not only by income\nbut also by social rank. The material to be used for clothing was also\nlegally prescribed. Only royalty could wear expensive materials like\nermine and fur, or silk, velvet and brocade. Other\nclasses were debarred from clothing themselves with\nmaterials that were associated with the aristocracy.\nThe French Revolution ended these distinctions. As\nyou know from Chapter I, members of the Jacobin\nclubs even called themselves the ‘sans culottes’ to\ndistinguish themselves from the aristocracy who\nwore the fashionable ‘knee breeches’. Sans culottes\nliterally meant those ‘without knee breeches’. From\nnow on, both men and women began wearing\nclothing that was loose and comfortable. The colours\nof France – blue, white and red – became popular as\nthey were a sign of the patriotic citizen. Other\npolitical symbols too became a part of dress: the red\ncap of liberty, long trousers and the revolutionary\ncockade pinned on to a hat. The simplicity of clothing\nwas meant to express the idea of equality.\n1\t1\t1\t1\t1 Sumptuary Laws and Social Hierarchy\tSumptuary Laws and Social Hierarchy\tSumptuary Laws and Social Hierarchy\tSumptuary Laws and Social Hierarchy\tSumptuary Laws and Social Hierarchy\nNew words\nCockade – Cap, usually worn on one side.\nErmine – Type of fur.\nFig.1 – An upper-class couple in eighteenth-century England.\nPainting by the English artist Thomas Gainsborough (1727-\n1788)\n© NCERT\nnot to be republished\n\n-- 171 of 189 --\n\nClothing: A Social History\n161\nActivity\nFig.3 – Woman of the middle classes, 1791.\nFig.4 – Volunteers during the French Revolution.\nFig.5 – A sans-culottes family, 1793.\nNot all sumptuary laws were meant to emphasise social hierarchy.\nSome sumptuary laws were passed to protect home production\nagainst imports. For instance, in sixteenth-century England, velvet\ncaps made with material imported from France and Italy were popular\namongst men. England passed a law which compelled all persons\nover six years of age, except those of high position, to wear woollen\ncaps made in England, on Sundays and all holy days. This law\nremained in effect for twenty-six years and was very useful in building\nup the English woollen industry.\nLook at Figures 2 - 5.

The French Revolution\nhad raised the question of equality and ended aristocratic privileges,\nas well as the laws that maintained those privileges. However,\ndifferences between social strata remained. Clearly, the poor could\nnot dress like the rich, nor eat the same food. But laws no longer\nbarred people’s right to dress in the way they wished. Differences in\nearning, rather than sumptuary laws, now defined what the rich and\npoor could wear. And different classes developed their own culture\nof dress. The notion of what was beautiful or ugly, proper or\nimproper, decent or vulgar, differed.\nStyles of clothing also emphasised differences between men and\nwomen. Women in Victorian England were groomed from childhood\nto be docile and dutiful, submissive and obedient. The ideal woman\nwas one who could bear pain and suffering. While men were expected\nto be serious, strong, independent and aggressive, women were seen\nas frivolous, delicate, passive and docile. Norms of clothing reflected\nthese ideals. From childhood, girls were tightly laced up and dressed\nin stays. The effort was to restrict the growth of their bodies, contain\nthem within small moulds. When slightly older, girls had to wear\ntight fitting corsets. Tightly laced, small-waisted women were\nadmired as attractive, elegant and graceful. Clothing thus played a\npart in creating the image of frail, submissive Victorian women.\n2.1 How Did Women React to These Norms?\nMany women believed in the ideals of womanhood. The ideals were\nin the air they breathed, the literature they read, the education they\nhad received at school and at home. From childhood they grew up\nto believe that having a small waist was a womanly duty. Suffering\npain was essential to being a woman. To be seen as attractive, to be\nwomanly, they had to wear the corset. The torture and pain this\ninflicted on the body was to be accepted as normal.\nBut not everyone accepted these values. Over the nineteenth century,\nideas changed. By the 1830s, women in England began agitating for\ndemocratic rights. As the suffrage movement developed, many began\ncampaigning for dress reform. Women’s magazines described how\ntight dresses and corsets caused deformities and illness among young\nNew words\nStays – Support as part of a woman’s dress\nto hold the body straight\nCorset – A closely fitting and stiff inner\nbodice, worn by women to give shape and\nsupport to the figure.\nSuffrage – The right to vote. The suffragettes\nwanted the right for women to vote.\nFig.6 – Scene at an upper-class wedding by the\nEnglish painter William Hogarth (1697-1764)\nFig.7 – A child in an aristocratic household by\nthe English painter William Hogarth (1697-\n1764).

Traditional feminine clothes were criticised on a\nvariety of grounds. Long skirts, it was said, swept the grounds and\ncollected filth and dirt. This caused illness. The skirts were\nvoluminous and difficult to handle. They hampered movement and\nprevented women from working and earning. Reform of the dress,\nit was said, would change the position of women. If clothes were\ncomfortable and convenient, then women could work, earn their\nliving, and become independent. In the 1870s, the National Woman\nSuffrage Association headed by Mrs Stanton, and the American\nWoman Suffrage Association dominated by Lucy Stone both\ncampaigned for dress reform. The argument was: simplify dress,\nshorten skirts, and abandon corsets. On both sides of the Atlantic,\nthere was now a movement for rational dress reform.\nThe movement for Rational Dress Reform\nMrs Amelia Bloomer, an American, was the first dress reformer to\nlaunch loose tunics worn over ankle-length trousers. The trousers\nwere known as ‘bloomers’, ‘rationals’, or ‘knickerbockers’. The\nRational Dress Society was started in England in 1881, but did not\nachieve significant results. It was the First World War that brought\nabout radical changes in women’s clothing.\nThe reformers did not immediately succeed in changing social values.\nThey had to face ridicule and hostility. Conservatives everywhere\nopposed change. They lamented that women who gave up traditional\nnorms of dressing no longer looked beautiful, and lost their femininty\nand grace. Faced with persistent attacks, many women reformers\nchanged back into traditional clothes to conform to conventions.\nBy the end of the nineteenth century, however, change was clearly\nin the air. Ideals of beauty and styles of clothing were both\ntransformed under a variety of pressures. People began accepting\nthe ideas of reformers they had earlier ridiculed. With new times\ncame new values.\nFig.8 – A woman in nineteenth-century\nUSA, before the dress reforms.\nNotice the flowing gown sweeping the\nground. Reformers reacted to this type\nof clothing for women.\n© NCERT\nnot to be republished\n\n-- 175 of 189 --\n\nClothing: A Social History\n165\n3 New Times\nWhat were these new values? What created the pressure for change?\nMany changes were made possible in Britain due to the introduction\nof new materials and technologies. Other changes came about because\nof the two world wars and the new working conditions for women.\nLet us retrace our steps a few centuries to see what these changes\nwere.\n3.1 New Materials\nBefore the seventeenth century, most ordinary women in Britain\npossessed very few clothes made of flax, linen or wool, which were\ndifficult to clean. After 1600, trade with India brought cheap,\nbeautiful and easy-to-maintain Indian chintzes within the reach of\nmany Europeans who could now increase the size of their wardrobes.\nThen, during the Industrial Revolution, in the nineteenth century,\nBritain began the mass manufacture of cotton textiles which it\nexported to many parts of the world, including India. Cotton clothes\nbecame more accessible to a wider section of people in Europe. By\nthe early twentieth century, artificial fibres made clothes\ncheaper still and easier to wash and maintain.\nIn the late 1870s, heavy, restrictive\nunderclothes, which had created such a\nstorm in the pages of women’s magazines,\nwere gradually discarded. Clothes got lighter,\nshorter and simpler.\nNew words\nChintz – Cotton cloth printed with designs\nand flowers. From the Hindi word chint.\nFig.9a – Even for middle- and upper-class\nwomen, clothing styles changed. Skirts\nbecame shorter and frills were done away with.\nFig.9 – Changes in clothing in the early\ntwentieth century.\nFig.9b – Women working at a British\nammunition factory during the First World War.\nAt this time thousands of women came out to\nwork as war production created a demand for\nincreased labour.The need for easy movement\nchanged clothing styles.\n© NCERT\nnot to be republished\n\n-- 176 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n166\nYet until 1914, clothes were ankle length, as they had been since the\nthirteenth century. By 1915, however, the hemline of the skirt rose\ndramatically to mid-calf.\nWhy this sudden change?\n3.2 The War\nChanges in women’s clothing came about as a result of the two World\nwars.\nMany European women stopped wearing jewellery and luxurious\nclothes. As upper-class women mixed with other classes, social barriers\nwere eroded and women began to dress in similar ways.\nClothes got shorter during the First World War (1914-1918) out of\npractical necessity. By 1917, over 700,000 women in Britain were\nemployed in ammunition factories. They wore a working uniform\nof blouse and trousers with accessories such as scarves, which was\nlater replaced by khaki overalls and caps. Bright colours faded from\nsight and only sober colours were worn as the war dragged on. Thus\nclothes became plainer and simpler. Skirts became shorter. Soon\ntrousers became a vital part of Western women’s clothing, giving\nthem greater freedom of movement. Most important, women took\nto cutting their hair short for convenience.\nBy the twentieth century, a plain and austere style came to reflect\nseriousness and professionalism. New schools for children emphasised\nthe importance of plain dressing, and discouraged ornamentation.\nGymnastics and games entered the school curriculum for women.\nAs women took to sports, they had to wear clothes that did not\nhamper movement. When they went out to work they needed clothes\nthat were comfortable and convenient.\nSo we see that the history of clothing is linked to the larger history\nof society. We saw how clothing was defined by dominant cultural\nattitudes and ideals of beauty, and how these notions changed over\ntime. We saw how reformers and conservatives struggled to shape\nthese ideals, and how changes within technology and economy, and\nthe pressures of new times made people feel the need for change.\n© NCERT\nnot to be republished\n\n-- 177 of 189 --\n\nClothing: A Social History\n167\nWhat about India in this same period?\nDuring the colonial period there were significant changes in male and\nfemale clothing in India. On the one hand this was a consequence of\nthe influence of Western dress forms and missionary activity; on the\nother it was due to the effort by Indians to fashion clothing styles that\nembodied an indigenous tradition and culture. Cloth and clothing in\nfact became very important symbols of the national movement. A\nbrief look at the nineteenth century changes will tell us a great deal\nabout the transformations of the twentieth century.\nWhen western-style clothing came into India in the nineteenth century,\nIndians reacted in three different ways:\nOne. Many, especially men, began incorporating some elements of\nwestern-style clothing in their dress. The wealthy Parsis of western\nIndia were among the first to adapt Western-style clothing. Baggy\ntrousers and the phenta (or hat) were added to long collarless coats,\nwith boots and a walking stick to complete the look of the gentleman.\nTo some, Western clothes were a sign of modernity and progress.\nWestern-style clothing was also especially attractive to groups of dalit\nconverts to Christianity who now found it liberating. Here too, it\nwas men rather than women who affected the new dress styles.\nTwo. There were others who were convinced that western culture\nwould lead to a loss of traditional cultural identity. The use of Western-\nstyle clothes was taken as a sign of the world turning upside down.\nThe cartoon of the Bengali Babu shown here,\nmocks him for wearing Western-style boots\nand hat and coat along with his dhoti.\nThree. Some men resolved this dilemma by\nwearing Western clothes without giving up\ntheir Indian ones. Many Bengali bureaucrats\nin the late nineteenth century began stocking\nwestern-style clothes for work outside the\nhome and changed into more comfortable\nIndian clothes at home.

This difference between outer and inner worlds is\nstill observed by some men today.\nStill others tried a slightly different solution to the same dilemma. They\nattempted to combine Western and Indian forms of dressing.\nThese changes in clothing, however, had a turbulent history.\n4.1 Caste Conflict and Dress Change\nThough there were no formal sumptuary laws as in Europe, India\nhad its own strict social codes of food and dress. The caste system\nclearly defined what subordinate and dominant caste Hindus should\nwear, eat, etc., and these codes had the force of law. Changes in\nclothing styles that threatened these norms therefore often created\nviolent social reactions.\nIn May 1822, women of the Shanar caste were attacked by Nairs in\npublic places in the southern princely state of Travancore, for wearing a\ncloth across their upper bodies. Over subsequent decades, a violent conflict\nover dress codes ensued.\nThe Shanars (later known as Nadars), many of whom were considered a\n‘subordinate caste’ and so were generally prohibited from using umbrellas\nand wearing shoes or golden ornaments. Men and women were also\nexpected to follow the local custom of never covering their upper bodies\nbefore the dominant castes.\nUnder the influence of Christian missionaries, Shanar women converts\nbegan in the 1820s to wear tailored blouses and cloths to cover themselves\nlike the dominant castes. Hindu reformers such as Ayya Vaikunder also\nparticipated in dress reform. Soon Nairs, one of the dominant castes of\nthe region, attacked these women in public places and tore off their\nupper cloths. Complaints were also filed in court against this dress change,\nespecially since Shanars were also refusing to render free labour for the\ndominant castes.\nAt first, the Government of Travancore issued a proclamation in\n1829 ordering Shanar women ‘to abstain in future from covering the\nupper parts of the body.’ But this did not prevent Shanar Christian\nwomen, and even Shanar Hindus, from adopting the blouse and\nupper cloth.\nThe abolition of slavery in Travancore in 1855 led to even more\nfrustration among the dominant castes who felt they were losing control.\nIn October 1859, riots broke out as Shanar women were attacked in\nThe term Nadar came to be used for all Shanars\nby the time of the 1921 census.\nActivity\nTry and find out more about reformers of the\ntime, such as Ayya Vaikunder, who were\nengaged in dress and wider social reforms.\n© NCERT\nnot to be republished\n\n-- 179 of 189 --\n\nClothing: A Social History\n169\nBox 3\nthe marketplace and stripped of their upper cloths. Houses were looted\nand chapels burned. Finally, the government issued another\nproclamation permitting Shanar women, whether Christian or Hindu,\nto wear a jacket, or cover their upper bodies ‘in any manner whatever,\nbut not like the women of high caste’.\n4.2 British Rule and Dress Codes\nHow did the British react to Indian ways of dressing? How did Indians\nreact to British attitudes?\nIn different cultures, specific items of clothing often convey contrary\nmeanings. This frequently leads to misunderstanding and conflict. Styles\nof clothing in British India changed through such conflicts.\nConsider the case of the turban and the hat. When European traders\nfirst began frequenting India, they were distinguished from the Indian\n‘turban wearers’ as the ‘hat wearers.’ These two headgears not only\nlooked different, they also signified different things. The turban in\nIndia was not just for protection from the heat but was a sign of\nrespectability, and could not be removed at will. In the Western\ntradition, the hat had to be removed before social superiors as a sign of\nrespect. This cultural difference created misunderstanding. The British\nwere often offended if Indians did not take off their turban when they\nmet colonial officials. Many Indians on the other hand wore the turban\nto consciously assert their regional or national identity.\nAnother such conflict related to the wearing of shoes. At the beginning\nof the nineteenth century, it was customary for British officials to\nfollow Indian etiquette and remove their footwear in the courts of\nruling kings or chiefs. Some British officials also wore Indian clothes.\nBut in 1830, Europeans were forbidden from wearing Indian clothes\nat official functions, so that the cultural identity of the white masters\nwas not undermined.\nThe turban on the head\nThe Mysore turban, called peta, was edged with gold lace, and adopted\nas part of the Durbar dress of the Mysore court in the mid-nineteenth\ncentury. By the end of the nineteenth century, a wide variety of officials,\nteachers and artists in Mysore began wearing the turban, sometimes\nwith the Western suit, as a sign of belonging to the princely state.\nToday, the Mysore turban is used largely on ceremonial occasions and\nto honour visiting dignitaries.\nFig.14 – Europeans bringing gifts to Shah\nJehan, Agra, 1633, from the Padshahnama.\nNotice the European visitors’ hats at the\nbottom of the picture, creating a contrast with\nthe turbans of the courtiers.\nFig.15 – Sir M.

He said:\n‘Taking off my pugree would have been\na greater insult to myself than to the\ncourt, but I would have submitted to it,\nbecause there is nothing of conscience,\nor religion involved in it. I hold no respect\nor disrespect, embodied or disembodied\nin the shoes, but the putting on of our\nturban is the greatest of all respects that\nwe pay. We do not have our pugrees on\nwhen at home, but when we go out to\nsee respectable persons we are bound\nby social etiquette to have it on whilst\nwe [Parsees] in our social intercourse\nnever ever take off our shoes before any\nParsee however great …’\nImagine yourself to be a Muslim pleader in\nthe Allahabad high court in the late nineteenth\ncentury. What kind of clothes would you wear?\nWould they be very different from what you\nwore at home?\nAt the same time, Indians were expected to wear Indian clothes to office\nand follow Indian dress codes. In 1824 - 1828, Governor-General Amherst\ninsisted that Indians take their shoes off as a sign of respect when they\nappeared before him, but this was not strictly followed. By the mid-\nnineteenth century, when Lord Dalhousie was Governor- General, ‘shoe\nrespect’ was made stricter, and Indians were made to take off their shoes\nwhen entering any government institution; only those who wore European\nclothes were exempted from this rule. Many Indian government servants\nwere increasingly uncomfortable with these rules.\nIn 1862, there was a famous case of defiance of the ‘shoe respect’ rule in\na Surat courtroom. Manockjee Cowasjee Entee, an assessor in the Surat\nFouzdaree Adawlut, refused to take off his shoes in the court of the\nsessions judge. The judge insisted that he take off his shoes as that was the\nIndian way of showing respect to superiors. But Manockjee remained\nadamant. He was barred entry into the courtroom and he sent a letter of\nprotest to the governor of Bombay.\nThe British insisted that since Indians took off their shoes when they\nentered a sacred place or home, they should do so when they entered\nthe courtroom. In the controversy that followed, Indians urged that\ntaking off shoes in sacred places and at home was linked to two\ndifferent questions. One: there was the problem of dirt and filth.\nShoes collected the dirt on the road. This dirt could not be allowed\ninto spaces that were clean, particularly when people in Indian homes\nsat on the ground. Second, leather shoes and the filth that stuck\nunder it were seen as polluting. But public buildings like the\ncourtroom were different from home.\nBut it took many years before shoes were permitted into\nthe courtroom.\n© NCERT\nnot to be republished\n\n-- 181 of 189 --\n\nClothing: A Social History\n171\n5 Designing the National Dress\nAs nationalist feelings swept across India by the late nineteenth\ncentury, Indians began devising cultural symbols that would express\nthe unity of the nation. Artists looked for a national style of art.\nPoets wrote national songs. Then a debate began over the design of\nthe national flag. The search for a national dress was part of this\nmove to define the cultural identity of the nation in symbolic ways.\nSelf-conscious experiments with dress engaged men and women of\nthe upper classes and castes in many parts of India. The Tagore family\nof Bengal experimented, beginning in the 1870s, with designs for a\nnational dress for both men and women in India. Rabindranath\nTagore suggested that instead of combining Indian and European\ndress, India’s national dress should combine elements of Hindu and\nMuslim dress. Thus the chapkan (a long buttoned coat) was considered\nthe most suitable dress for men.\nThere were also attempts to develop a dress style that would draw\non the tradition of different regions. In the late 1870s, Jnanadanandini\nDevi, wife of Satyendranath Tagore, the first Indian member of the\nICS, returned from Bombay to Calcutta. She adopted the Parsi\nstyle of wearing the sari pinned to the left shoulder with a brooch,\nand worn with a blouse and shoes. This was quickly adopted by\nBrahmo Samaji women and came to be known as the Brahmika sari.\nThis style gained acceptance before long among Maharashtrian and\nUttar Pradesh Brahmos, as well as non-Brahmos.\nNew words\nBrahmo – Those belonging to the Brahmo Samaj\nFig.17 – Jnanadanandini Tagore (on the left)\nwith her husband Satyendranath Tagore and\nother family members.

Women of Gujarat, Kodagu, Kerala and Assam continue\nto wear different types of sari.\nThese two quotations (Sources E and F),\nfrom about the same period are from two\ndifferent regions of India, Kerala and Bengal.\nWhat do they tell you about the very different\nnotions of shame regarding women’s attire?\nSource E\nSource F\nSome people supported the attempt to change women’s clothing, others\nopposed it.\n‘Any civilised nation is against the kind of clothing in use in the\npresent time among women of our country. Indeed it is a sign of\nshamelessness. Educated men have been greatly agitated about\nit, almost everyone wishes for another kind of civilised clothing …\nthere is a custom here of women wearing fine and transparent\nclothing which reveals the whole body. Such shameless attire in no\nway allows one to frequent civilised company … such clothes can\nstand in the way of our moral improvement.’\nSoudamini Khastagiri, Striloker Paricchad (1872)\nC. Kesavan’s autobiography Jeevita Samaram recalls his\nmother-in-law’s first encounter with a blouse gifted by her\nsister-in-law in the late nineteenth century:\n‘It looked good, but I felt ticklish wearing it. I took it off, folded\nit carefully and brimming with enthusiasm, showed it to my\nmother. She gave me a stern look and said “Where are you\ngoing to gallivant in this? Fold it and keep it in the box.” … I\nwas scared of my mother. She could kill me. At night I wore the\nblouse and showed it to my husband. He said it looked good …\n[the next morning] I came out wearing the blouse … I didn’t\nnotice my mother coming. Suddenly I heard her break a piece\nfrom a coconut branch. When I turned round, she was behind\nme fierce and furious … she said “Take it off … you want to\nwalk around in shirts like Muslim women?”’\n5.1 The Swadeshi Movement\nYou have read about the Swadeshi movement in Bengal in the first\ndecade of the twentieth century. If you reflect back on the movement\nyou will realize that it was centrally linked to the politics of clothing.\nWhat was this politics?\nYou know that the British first came to trade in Indian textiles that\nwere in great demand all over the world. India accounted for one-\nfourth of the world’s manufactured goods in the seventeenth century.\nThere were a million weavers in Bengal alone in the middle of the\nFig.19 – Maharani of Travancore (1930).\nNote the Western shoes and the modest long-\nsleeved blouse. This style had become\ncommon among the upper classes by the early\ntwentieth century.\n© NCERT\nnot to be republished\n\n-- 183 of 189 --\n\nClothing: A Social History\n173\nActivity\neighteenth century. However, the Industrial Revolution in Britain,\nwhich mechanised spinning and weaving and greatly increased the\ndemand for raw materials such as cotton and indigo, changed\nIndia’s status in the world economy.\nPolitical control of India helped the British in two ways: Indian\npeasants could be forced to grow crops such as indigo, and cheap\nBritish manufacture easily replaced coarser Indian one. Large\nnumbers of Indian weavers and spinners were left without work,\nand important textile weaving centres such as Murshidabad,\nMachilipatnam and Surat declined as demand fell.\nYet by the middle of the twentieth century, large numbers of\npeople began boycotting British or mill-made cloth and adopting\nkhadi, even though it was coarser, more expensive and difficult\nto obtain. How did this change come about?\nIn 1905, Lord Curzon decided to partition Bengal to control the\ngrowing opposition to British rule. The Swadeshi movement\ndeveloped in reaction to this measure. People were urged to\nboycott British goods of all kinds and start their own industries\nfor the manufacture of goods such as matchboxes and cigarettes.\nMass protests followed, with people vowing to cleanse themselves\nof colonial rule. The use of khadi was made a patriotic duty.\nWomen were urged to throw away their silks and glass bangles\nand wear simple shell bangles. Rough homespun was glorified in\nsongs and poems to popularise it.\nThe change of dress appealed largely to the upper castes\nand classes rather than to those who had to make do with\nless and could not afford the new products. After 15 years,\nmany among the upper classes also returned to wearing\nEuropean dress.\nThough many people rallied to the cause of nationalism at\nthis time, it was almost impossible to compete with cheap\nBritish goods that had flooded the market.\nDespite its limitations, the experiment with Swadeshi gave\nMahatma Gandhi important ideas about using cloth as a\nsymbolic weapon against British rule.\n5.2 Mahatma Gandhi’s Experiments with Clothing\nThe most familiar image of Mahatma Gandhi is of him seated,\nbare chested and in a short dhoti, at the spinning wheel. He\nIf you were a poor peasant would you have\nwillingly taken to giving up mill-made cloth?\nFig.20 – The familiar image of Mahatma Gandhi, bare\nchested and at his spinning wheel.\n© NCERT\nnot to be republished\n\n-- 184 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n174\nmade spinning on the charkha and the daily use of khadi, or coarse\ncloth made from homespun yarn, very powerful symbols. These\nwere not only symbols of self-reliance but also of resistance to the\nuse of British mill-made cloth.\nMahatma Gandhi’s experiments with clothing sum up the changing\nattitude to dress in the Indian subcontinent. As a boy from a Gujarati\nBania family, he usually wore a shirt with a dhoti or pyjama, and\nsometimes a coat. When he went to London to study law as a boy of\n19 in 1888, he cut off the tuft on his head and dressed in a Western\nsuit so that he would not be laughed at. On his return, he continued\nto wear Western suits, topped with a turban. As a lawyer\nin Johannesburg, South Africa in the 1890s, he still wore\nWestern clothes.\nSoon he decided that dressing ‘unsuitably’ was a more powerful\npolitical statement. In Durban in 1913, Gandhi first appeared in a\nlungi and kurta with his head shaved as a sign of mourning to protest\nagainst the shooting of Indian coal miners.\nOn his return to India in 1915, he decided to dress like a Kathiawadi\npeasant. Only in 1921 did he adopt the short dhoti, the form of\ndress he wore until his death. On 22 September 1921, a year after\nlaunching the non-cooperation movement, which sought swaraj in\none year, he announced:\nFig.21 – Mahatma\nGandhi in his\nearliest known\npicture, aged 7.\nFig.22 – Mahatma\nGandhi at age 14,\nwith a friend.\nFig.23 – Mahatma Gandhi (seated front right) London,\n1890, at the age of 21. Note the typical Western\nthree-piece suit.\nFig.24 – In Johannesburg\nin 1900, still in Western\ndress, including tie.\nFig. 25 – In\n1913 in South\nAfrica, dressed\nfor Satyagraha\n© NCERT\nnot to be republished\n\n-- 185 of 189 --\n\nClothing: A Social History\n175\n‘I propose to discard at least up to 31st of October my topi and\nvest and to content myself with a loincloth, and a chaddar whenever\nnecessary for protection of my body. I adopt the change because\nI have always hesitated to advise anything I may not be prepared\nto follow …’\nAt this time, he did not want to use this dress all his life and only\nwanted to ‘experiment for a month or two’. But soon he saw this\nas his duty to the poor, and he never wore any other dress. He\nconsciously rejected the well-known clothes of the Indian ascetic\nand adopted the dress of the poorest Indian. Khadi, white and\ncoarse, was to him a sign of purity, of simplicity, and of poverty.\nWearing it became also a symbol of nationalism, a rejection of\nWestern mill- made cloth.\nHe wore the short dhoti without a shirt when he went to England\nfor the Round Table Conference in 1931. He refused to\ncompromise and wore it even before King George V at\nBuckingham Palace. When he was asked by journalists whether\nhe was wearing enough clothes to go before the King, he joked\nthat that ‘the King had enough on for both of us’!\nFig.26 – Mahatma Gandhi with Kasturba,\nshortly after his return from South Africa.\nDressed simply, he later confessed to feeling\nawkward amongst the Westernised Bombay\nelite. He said that he was more at home\namong the labourers in South Africa.\n© NCERT\nnot to be republished\n\n-- 186 of 189 --\n\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n176\nActivity\nCan you think of other reasons why the use\nof khadi could not spread among some\nclasses, castes and regions of India?\n5.3 Not All could Wear Khadi\nMahatma Gandhi’s dream was to clothe the whole nation in khadi.\nHe felt khadi would be a means of erasing difference between religions,\nclasses, etc. But was it easy for others to follow in his footsteps? Was\nsuch a unity possible? Not many could take to the single peasant\nloincloth as he had. Nor did all want to. Here are some examples of\nother responses to Mahatma Gandhi’s call:\n· Nationalists such as Motilal Nehru, a successful barrister from\nAllahabad, gave up his expensive Western-style suits and adopted the\nIndian dhoti and kurta. But these were not made of coarse cloth.\n· Those who had been deprived by caste norms for centuries were\nattracted to Western dress styles. Therefore, unlike Mahatma Gandhi,\nother nationalists such as Babasaheb Ambedkar never gave up the\nWestern-style suit. Many Dalits began in the early 1910s to wear three-\npiece suits, and shoes and socks on all public occasions, as a political\nstatement of self-respect.\n· A woman who wrote to Mahatma Gandhi from Maharashtra in\n1928 said, ‘A year ago, I heard you speaking on the extreme necessity\nof every one of us wearing khadi and thereupon decided to adopt it.\nBut we are poor people, My husband says khadi is costly. Belonging\nas I do to Maharashtra, I wear a sari nine yards long … (and) the elders\nwill not hear of a reduction (to six yards).’\n· Other women, like Sarojini Naidu and Kamala Nehru, wore coloured\nsaris with designs, instead of coarse, white homespun.\nConclusion\nChanges in styles of clothing are thus linked up with shifts in cultural\ntastes and notions of beauty, with changes within the economy and\nsociety, and with issues of social and political conflict. So when we see\nclothing styles alter we need to ask: why do these changes take place?\nWhat do they tell us about society and its history? What can they tell\nus about changes in tastes and technologies, markets and industries?\n© NCERT\nnot to be republished\n\n-- 187 of 189 --\n\nClothing: A Social History\n177\nBox 4\nThe Gandhi cap\nSome time after his return to India from South Africa in 1915, Mahatma Gandhi transformed the Kashmiri cap that he\nsometimes used into a cheap white cotton khadi cap. For two years from 1919, he himself wore the cap, and then gave\nit up, but by this time it had become part of the nationalist uniform and even a symbol of defiance. For example, the\nGwalior state tried to prohibit its use in 1921 during the non co-operation movement. During the Khilafat movement the\ncap was worn by large numbers of Hindus and Muslims. A group of Santhals who attacked the police in 1922 in Bengal\ndemanding the release of Santhal prisoners believed that the Gandhi cap would protect them from bullets: three of\nthem died as a result.\nLarge numbers of nationalists defiantly wore the Gandhi cap and were even beaten or arrested for doing so. With the\nrise of the Khilafat movement in the post-First World War years, the fez, a tasseled Turkish cap, became a sign of anti-\ncolonialism in India. Though many Hindus – as in Hyderabad for instance – also wore the fez, it soon became identified\nsolely with Muslims.\nFig.27 –\n1915.\nMahatma\nGandhi with a\nturban.\nFig.28 –\n1915.
