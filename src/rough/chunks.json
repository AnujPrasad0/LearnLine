      "chunk_text": "iii\nFOREWORD\nThe National Curriculum Framework, 2005, recommends\nthat children’s life at school must be linked to their life\noutside the school. This principle marks a departure from\nthe legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our\nsystem and causes a gap between the school, home and\ncommunity. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis\nof NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They\nalso attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance\nof sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope\nthese measures will take us significantly further in the\ndirection of a child-centred system of education outlined in\nthe National Policy on Education (1986).\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school\nprincipals and teachers will take to encourage children to\nreflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative\nactivities and questions. We must recognise that, given space,\ntime and freedom, children generate new knowledge by\nengaging with the information passed on to them by adults.\nTreating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of\nexamination is one of the key reasons why other resources\nand sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and\ninitiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as\nparticipants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of\nknowledge.\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines\nand mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table\nis as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual\ncalendar so that the required number of teaching days are\nactually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching\nand evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook\nproves for making children’s life at school a happy experience,\nrather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers\nhave tried to address the problem of curricular burden by\nrestructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages\nwith greater consideration for child psychology and the time\navailable for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance\nthis endeavor by giving higher priority and space to\nopportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion\nin small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.\nNCERT appreciates the hard work done by the textbook\ndevelopment committee responsible for this book. We wish\nto thank the Chairperson of the Advisory Committee for\n2019-200",

They evolved\nthrough discussions in workshops, and exchanges of ideas\nthrough emails, with each member contributing their skill\nin many different ways. All of us learnt a lot in the process.\nMany individuals and institutions helped in the\nproduction of the book. Professor Muzaffar Alam and\nDr Kumkum Roy read drafts and offered suggestions for\nchange. We drew upon the image collections of several\ninstitutions in illustrating the book. A number of photographs\nof the city of Delhi and of the events of 1857 are from the\nAlkazi Foundation for the Arts. Many of the nineteenth-\ncentury illustrated books on the British Raj are to be found\nin the valuable India Collection of the India International\nCentre. We are particularly glad that Sunil Janah, now 90\nyears of age, has given us permission to reproduce his\nphotographs. From the early 1940s, he has explored the tribal\nareas and recorded with his camera the daily life of different\ncommunities. Some of these photographs are now published\n(The Tribals of India, Oxford University of Press, 2003), and\nmany are at the Indira Gandhi National Centre for Arts.\nShalini Advani and Shyama Warner have done several\nrounds of editing with care and understanding, suggesting\nchanges, tracking mistakes and improving the text in\ninnumerable ways.

      "chunk_text": "1\nHow, When and Where 1\nHow Important are Dates?\nThere was a time when historians were\nfascinated with dates. There were heated\ndebates about the dates on which rulers\nwere crowned or battles were fought.\nIn the common-sense notion, history was\nsynonymous with dates. You may have\nheard people say, “I find history boring\nbecause it is all about memorising\ndates.” Is such a conception true?\nHistory is certainly about changes\nthat occur over time. It is about finding\nout how things were in the past and\nhow things have changed. As soon as\nwe compare the past with the present\nwe refer to time, we talk of “before” and\n“after”.\nLiving in the world we do not always\nask historical questions about what we\nsee around us. We take things for granted,\nas if what we see has always been in the\nworld we inhabit. But most of us have our\nmoments of wonder, when we are curious, and we ask\nquestions that actually are historical. Watching\nsomeone sip a cup of tea at a roadside tea stall you\nmay wonder – when did people begin to drink tea or\ncoffee? Looking out of the window of a train you may\nask yourself – when were railways built and how did\npeople travel long distances before the age of railways?\nReading the newspaper in the morning you may be\ncurious to know how people got to hear about things\nbefore newspapers began to be printed.",

      "chunk_text": "OUR PASTS – III 2\nAll such historical questions refer us back to notions\nof time. But time does not have to be always precisely\ndated in terms of a particular year or a month.\nSometimes it is actually incorrect to fix precise dates\nto processes that happen over a period of time. People\nin India did not begin drinking tea one fine day; they\ndeveloped a taste for it over time. There can be no one\nclear date for a process such as this. Similarly, we\ncannot fix one single date on which British rule was\nestablished, or the national movement started, or\nchanges took place within the economy and society. All\nthese things happened over a stretch of time. We can\nonly refer to a span of time, an approximate period over\nwhich particular changes became visible.\nWhy, then, do we continue to associate history\nwith a string of dates? This association has a reason.\nThere was a time when history was an account of\nbattles and big events. It was about rulers and their\npolicies. Historians wrote about the year a king was\ncrowned, the year he married, the year he had a child,\nthe year he fought a particular war, the year he died,\nand the year the next ruler succeeded to the throne.\nFor events such as these, specific dates can be\ndetermined, and in histories such as these, debates\nabout dates continue to be important.\nAs you have seen in the history textbooks of the past\ntwo years, historians now write about a host of other\nissues, and other questions. They look at how people\nearned their livelihood, what they produced and ate,\nhow cities developed and markets came up, how\nkingdoms were formed and new ideas spread, and how\ncultures and society changed.\nWhich dates?\nBy what criteria do we choose a set of dates as\nimportant? The dates we select, the dates around which\nwe compose our story of the past, are not important on\ntheir own. They become vital because we focus on a\nparticular set of events as important. If our focus of\nstudy changes, if we begin to look at new issues, a new\nset of dates will appear significant.\nConsider an example. In the histories written by\nBritish historians in India, the rule of each Governor-\nGeneral was important. These histories began with the\nrule of the first Governor-General, Warren Hastings,\nand ended with the last Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten. In\nseparate chapters we read about the deeds of others –",

It was\na seemingly never -ending succession of Governor -\nGenerals and Viceroys. All the dates in these history\nbooks were linked to these personalities – to their\nactivities, policies, achievements. It was as if there was\nnothing outside their lives that was important for us to\nknow. The chronology of their lives marked the different\nchapters of the history of British India.\nCan we not write about the history of this period in\na different way? How do we focus on the activities of\ndifferent groups and classes in Indian society within\nthe format of this history of Governor-Generals?\nWhen we write history, or a story, we divide it into\nchapters. Why do we do this? It is to give each chapter\nsome coherence. It is to tell a story in a way that makes\nsome sense and can be followed. In the process we focus\nonly on those events that help us to give shape to the\nstory we are telling. In the histories that revolve around\nthe life of British Governor-Generals, the activities of\nIndians simply do not fit, they have no space. What,\nthen, do we do? Clearly, we need another format for\nour history. This would mean that the old dates will no\nlonger have the significance they earlier had. A new\nset of dates will become more important for us to know.\nHow do we periodise?\nIn 1817, James Mill, a Scottish economist and political\nphilosopher, published a massive three-volume work,\nA History of British India. In this he divided Indian\nhistory into three periods – Hindu, Muslim and British.\nThis periodisation came to be widely accepted. Can\nyou think of any problem with this way of looking at\nIndian history?\nWhy do we try and divide history into different\nperiods? We do so in an attempt to capture the\ncharacteristics of a time, its central features as they\nappear to us. So the terms through which we periodise\n– that is, demarcate the difference between periods –\nbecome important. They reflect our ideas about the past.\nThey show how we see the significance of the change\nfrom one period to the next.\nMill thought that all Asian societies were at a lower\nlevel of civilisation than Europe. According to his telling\nof history, before the British came to India, Hindu and\nMuslim despots ruled the country.

Mill, in fact, suggested that\nthe British should conquer all the territories in India to ensure\nthe enlightenment and happiness of the Indian people. For\nIndia was not capable of progress without British help.\nIn this idea of history, British rule represented all the forces\nof progress and civilisation. The period before British rule\nwas one of darkness. Can such a conception be accepted today?\nIn any case, can we refer to any period of history as “Hindu”\nor “Muslim”? Did not a variety of faiths exist simultaneously\nin these periods? Why should we characterise an age only\nthrough the religion of the rulers of the time? To do so is to\nsuggest that the lives and practices of the others do not\nreally matter. We should also remember that even rulers in\nancient India did not all share the same faith.\nMoving away from British classification, historians have\nusually divided Indian history into ‘ancient’, ‘medieval’ and\n‘modern’. This division too has its problems. It is a\nperiodisation that is borrowed from the West where the\nmodern period was associated with the growth of all the\nforces of modernity – science, reason, democracy, liberty and\nequality. Medieval was a term used to describe a society\nwhere these features of modern society did not exist. Can we\nuncritically accept this characterisation of the modern period\nto describe the period of our study? As you will see in this\nbook, under British rule people did not have equality, freedom\nor liberty. Nor was the period one of economic growth\nand progress.\nMany historians therefore refer to this period as ‘colonial’.\nWhat is colonial?\nIn this book you will read about the way the British came to\nconquer the country and establish their rule, subjugating\nlocal nawabs and rajas. You will see how they established\ncontrol over the economy and society, collected revenue to\nmeet all their expenses, bought the goods they wanted at\nlow prices, produced crops they needed for export, and\nyou will understand the changes that came about as a\nconsequence. You will also come to know about the changes\nBritish rule brought about in values and tastes, customs\nand practices. When the subjugation of one country by another\nleads to these kinds of political, economic, social and cultural\nchanges, we refer to the process as colonisation.\nYou will, however, find that all classes and groups did not\nexperience these changes in the same way. That is why the\nbook is called Our Pasts in the plural.\n2019-200",

This conviction produced an\nadministrative culture of memos, notings and reports.\nThe British also felt that all important documents\nand letters needed to be carefully preserved. So they\nset up record rooms attached to all administrative\ninstitutions. The village tahsildar’s office, the\ncollectorate, the commissioner’s office, the provincial\nsecretariats, the lawcourts – all had their record rooms.\nSpecialised institutions like archives and museums were\nalso established to preserve important records.\nLetters and memos that moved from one branch\nof the administration to another in the early years\nof the nineteenth century can still be read in the\narchives. You can also study the notes and reports that\ndistrict officials prepared, or the instructions and\ndirectives that were sent by officials at the top to\nprovincial administrators.\nIn the early years of the nineteenth century these\ndocuments were carefully copied out and beautifully\nwritten by calligraphists – that is, by those who\nspecialised in the art of beautiful writing. By the middle\nof the nineteenth century, with the spread of printing,\nmultiple copies of these records were printed as\nproceedings of each government department.\nHOW, WHEN AND WHERE",

This meant that no other\ntrading group in England could\ncompete with the East India\nCompany. With this charter\nthe Company could venture\nacross the oceans, looking\nfor new lands from which it\ncould buy goods at a cheap price, and carry them\nback to Europe to sell at higher prices. The Company\ndid not have to fear competition from other English\ntrading companies.

The only way\nthe trading companies could flourish was by eliminating\nrival competitors.

The\ncompany therefore found it difficult to separate trade\nfrom politics. Let us see how this happened.\nEast India Company begins trade in Bengal\nThe first English factory was set up on the banks of\nthe river Hugli in 1651. This was the base from which\nthe Company’s traders, known at that time as “factors”,\noperated. The factory had a warehouse where goods\nfor export were stored, and it had offices where Company\nofficials sat. As trade expanded, the Company persuaded\nmerchants and traders to come and settle near the\nfactory. By 1696 it began building a fort around the\nsettlement. Two years later it bribed Mughal officials\ninto giving the Company zamindari rights over three\nvillages. One of these was Kalikata, which later grew\ninto the city of Calcutta or Kolkata as it is known today.\nIt also persuaded the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to\nissue a farman granting the Company the right to trade\nduty free.\nThe Company tried continuously to press for more\nconcessions and manipulate existing privileges.\nAurangzeb’s farman, for instance, had granted only\nthe Company the right to trade duty free. But officials\nof the Company, who were carrying on private trade on\nthe side, were expected to pay duty. This they refused\nto pay, causing an enormous loss of revenue for Bengal.\nHow could the Nawab of Bengal, Murshid Quli Khan,\nnot protest?",

Murshid Quli Khan was followed by\nAlivardi Khan and then Sirajuddaulah as the Nawab of\nBengal. Each one of them was a strong ruler. They refused\nto grant the Company concessions, demanded large\ntributes for the Company’s right to trade, denied it any\nright to mint coins, and stopped it from extending its\nfortifications. Accusing the Company of deceit, they\nclaimed that the Company was depriving the Bengal\ngovernment of huge amounts of revenue and\nundermining the authority of the nawab. It was refusing\nto pay taxes, writing disrespectful letters, and trying to\nhumiliate the nawab and his officials.\nThe Company on its part declared that the unjust\ndemands of the local officials were ruining the trade of\nthe Company, and trade could flourish only if the duties\nwere removed. It was also convinced that to expand\ntrade it had to enlarge its settlements, buy up villages,\nand rebuild its forts.\nThe conflicts led to confrontations and finally\nculminated in the famous Battle of Plassey.\nThe Battle of Plassey\nWhen Alivardi Khan died in 1756, Sirajuddaulah became\nthe nawab of Bengal. The Company was worried about\nhis power and keen on a puppet ruler who would\nwillingly give trade concessions and other privileges.\nSo it tried, though without success, to help one of\nSirajuddaulah’s rivals become the nawab. An infuriated\nSirajuddaulah asked the Company to stop meddling in\nthe political affairs of his dominion, stop fortification,\nand pay the revenues. After negotiations failed, the\nNawab marched with 30,000 soldiers to the English\nfactory at Kassimbazar, captured the Company officials,\nlocked the warehouse, disarmed all Englishmen, and\nblockaded English ships. Then he marched to Calcutta\nto establish control over the Company’s fort there.\nOn hearing the news of the fall of Calcutta, Company\nofficials in Madras sent forces under the command of\nRobert Clive, reinforced by naval fleets.

The\nCompany was still unwilling to take over the\nresponsibility of administration. Its prime objective was\nthe expansion of trade. If this could be done without\nconquest, through the help of local rulers who were\nwilling to grant privileges, then territories need not be\ntaken over directly.\nSoon the Company discovered that this was rather\ndifficult. For even the puppet nawabs were not always\nas helpful as the Company wanted them to be. After all,\nthey had to maintain a basic appearance of dignity and\nsovereignty if they wanted respect from their subjects.\nWhat could the Company do? When Mir Jafar\nprotested, the Company deposed him and installed Mir\nQasim in his place. When Mir Qasim complained, he in\nturn was defeated in a battle fought at Buxar (1764),\ndriven out of Bengal, and Mir Jafar was reinstalled. The\nNawab had to pay Rs 500,000 every month but the\nCompany wanted more money to finance its wars, and\nmeet the demands of trade and its other expenses. It\nwanted more territories and more revenue. By the time\nMir Jafar died in 1765 the mood of the Company had\nchanged. Having failed to work with puppet nawabs, Clive\ndeclared: “We must indeed become nawabs ourselves.”\nFinally, in 1765 the Mughal emperor appointed the\nCompany as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal. The\nDiwani allowed the Company to use the vast revenue\nresources of Bengal. This solved a major problem that\nthe Company had earlier faced. From the early eighteenth\ncentury its trade with India had expanded. But it had\nto buy most of the goods in India with gold and silver\nimported from Britain. This was because at this time\nBritain had no goods to sell in India. The outflow of\ngold from Britain slowed after the Battle of Plassey,\nand entirely stopped after the assumption of Diwani.\nNow revenues from India could finance Company\nexpenses. These revenues could be used to purchase\ncotton and silk textiles in India, maintain Company\ntroops, and meet the cost of building the Company fort\nand offices at Calcutta.\nCompany officials become “nabobs”\nWhat did it mean to be nawabs? It meant of course that\nthe Company acquired more power and authority. But\nit also meant something else. Each company servant\nbegan to have visions of living like nawabs.\nThe Nawab\ncomplains\nSource 2\nIn 1733 the Nawab of\nBengal said this about the\nEnglish traders:\nWhen they first came\ninto the country they\npetitioned the then\ngovernment in a\nhumble manner for\nliberty to purchase a\nspot of ground to\nbuild a factory house\nupon, which was no\nsooner granted but\nthey built a strong\nfort, surrounded it\nwith a ditch which has\ncommunication with\nthe river and mounted\na great number of\nguns upon the walls.\nThey have enticed\nseveral merchants\nand others to go and\ntake protection under\nthem and they collect\na revenue which\namounts to Rs 100, 000\n… they rob and\nplunder and carry\ngreat number of the\nking’s subjects of both\nsexes into slavery into\ntheir own country …\n2019-200",

Interestingly, when he was\nappointed Governor of Bengal in 1764, he was asked to\nremove corruption in Company administration but he\nwas himself cross-examined in 1772 by the British\nParliament which was suspicious of his vast wealth.\nAlthough he was acquitted, he committed suicide\nin 1774.\nHowever, not all Company officials succeeded in\nmaking money like Clive. Many died an early death\nin India due to disease and war and it would not be\nright to regard all of them as corrupt and dishonest.\nMany of them came from humble backgrounds and\ntheir uppermost desire was to earn enough in India,\nreturn to Britain and lead a comfortable life. Those\nwho managed to return with wealth led flashy lives\nand flaunted their riches. They were called “nabobs”\n– an anglicised version of the Indian word nawab.\nThey were often seen as upstarts and social climbers\nin British society and were ridiculed or made fun of\nin plays and cartoons.\nCompany Rule Expands\nIf we analyse the process of annexation of Indian states\nby the East India Company from 1757 to 1857, certain\nkey aspects emerge. The Company rarely launched a\ndirect military attack on an unknown territory. Instead\nit used a variety of political, economic and diplomatic\nmethods to extend its influence before annexing an\nIndian kingdom.\nAfter the Battle of Buxar (1764), the Company\nappointed Residents in Indian states. They were political\nor commercial agents and their job was to serve and\nfurther the interests of the Company.

These chiefs were held\ntogether in a confederacy under a Peshwa (Principal\nMinister) who became its effective military and\nadministrative head based in Pune. Mahadji Sindhia\nand Nana Phadnis were two famous Maratha soldiers\nand statesmen of the late eighteenth century.\nThe Marathas were subdued in a series of wars. In\nthe first war that ended in 1782 with the Treaty of\nSalbai, there was no clear victor. The Second Anglo-\nMaratha War (1803-05) was fought on different fronts,\nresulting in the British gaining Orissa and the\nterritories north of the Yamuna river including Agra\nand Delhi. Finally, the Third Anglo-Maratha War of\n1817-19 crushed Maratha power. The Peshwa was\nremoved and sent away to Bithur near Kanpur with a\npension. The Company now had complete control over\nthe territories south of the Vindhyas.\nThe claim to paramountcy\nIt is clear from the above that from the early nineteenth\ncentury the Company pursued an aggressive policy of\nterritorial expansion. Under Lord Hastings (Governor-\nGeneral from 1813 to 1823) a new policy of “paramountcy”\nwas initiated. Now the Company claimed that its authority\nwas paramount or supreme, hence its power was greater\nthan that of Indian states. In order to protect its interests\nit was justified in annexing or threatening to annex\nany Indian kingdom. This view continued to guide later\nBritish policies as well.\nThis process, however, did not go unchallenged. For\nexample, when the British tried to annex the small state\nof Kitoor (in Karnataka today), Rani Channamma took\nto arms and led an anti-British resistance movement.\nShe was arrested in 1824 and died in prison in 1829.\nBut Rayanna, a poor chowkidar of Sangoli in Kitoor,\ncarried on the resistance. With popular support he\ndestroyed many British camps and records. He was\ncaught and hanged by the British in 1830. You will\nread more about several cases of resistance later in\nthe book.",

The\ndoctrine declared that if an Indian ruler\ndied without a male heir his kingdom\nwould “lapse”, that is, become part of\nCompany territory. One kingdom after\nanother was annexed simply by\napplying this doctrine: Satara (1848), Sambalpur (1850),\nUdaipur (1852), Nagpur (1853) and Jhansi (1854).\nFinally, in 1856, the Company also took over Awadh.\nThis time the British had an added argument – they\nsaid they were “obliged by duty” to take over Awadh in\norder to free the people from the “misgovernment” of\nthe Nawab!

To bring about\nuniformity, in 1775 eleven pandits were asked to compile\na digest of Hindu laws. N.B. Halhed translated this\ndigest into English. By 1778 a code of Muslim laws was\nalso compiled for the benefit of European judges. Under\nthe Regulating Act of 1773, a new Supreme Court was\nestablished, while a court of appeal – the Sadar Nizamat\nAdalat – was also set up at Calcutta.\nThe principal figure in an Indian district was the\nCollector. As the title suggests, his main job was to\ncollect revenue and taxes and maintain law and order\nin his district with the help of judges, police officers\nand darogas. His office – the Collectorate – became the\nnew centre of power and patronage that steadily\nreplaced previous holders of authority.\nThe Company army\nColonial rule in India brought in some new ideas of\nadministration and reform but its power rested on its\nmilitary strength. The Mughal army was mainly\ncomposed of cavalry (sawars: trained soldiers on\nhorseback) and infantry, that is, paidal (foot) soldiers.\nThey were given training in archery (teer-andazi) and\nthe use of the sword. The cavalry dominated the army\nand the Mughal state did not feel the need to have a large\nprofessionally trained infantry. The rural areas had a\nlarge number of armed peasants and the local zamindars\noften supplied the Mughals with paidal soldiers.\nA change occurred in the eighteenth century when\nMughal successor states like Awadh and Benaras started\nrecruiting peasants into their armies and training them\nas professional soldiers. The East India Company adopted\nthe same method when it began recruitment for its own\narmy, which came to be known as the sepoy army (from\nthe Indian word sipahi, meaning soldier).\nAs warfare technology changed from the 1820s, the\ncavalry requirements of the Company’s army declined.\nThis is because the British empire was fighting in\nBurma, Afghanistan and Egypt where soldiers were\narmed with muskets and matchlocks. The soldiers of\nthe Company’s army had to keep pace with changing\nmilitary requirements and its infantry regiments now\nbecame more important.\nIn the early nineteenth century the British began\nto develop a uniform military culture.

In this chapter we will see\nhow the Company came to colonise the countryside, organise\nrevenue resources, redefine the rights of people, and produce\nthe crops it wanted.\nRevenue for the Company\nThe Company had become the Diwan, but it still saw itself\nprimarily as a trader. It wanted a large revenue income but\nwas unwilling to set up any regular system of assessment\nand collection. The effort was to increase the revenue as much\nas it could and buy fine cotton and silk cloth as cheaply as\npossible. Within five years the value of goods bought by the\nCompany in Bengal doubled. Before 1865, the Company had\npurchased goods in India by importing gold and silver from\nBritain. Now the revenue collected in Bengal could finance\nthe purchase of goods for export.\nSoon it was clear that the Bengal economy was facing\na deep crisis. Artisans were deserting villages since they\nwere being forced to sell their goods to the Company at low\nprices. Peasants were unable to pay the dues that were being\ndemanded from them.

Most Company officials\nbegan to feel that investment in land had to be\nencouraged and agriculture had to be improved.\nHow was this to be done? After two decades of debate\non the question, the Company finally introduced the\nPermanent Settlement in 1793. By the terms of the\nsettlement, the rajas and taluqdars were recognised\nas zamindars. They were asked to collect rent from\nthe peasants and pay revenue to the Company. The\namount to be paid was fixed permanently, that is, it\nwas not to be increased ever in future. It was felt that\nthis would ensure a regular flow of revenue into the\nCompany’s coffers and at the same time encourage\nthe zamindars to invest in improving the land. Since\nthe revenue demand of the state would not be\nincreased, the zamindar would benefit from increased\nproduction from the land.\nThe problem\nThe Permanent Settlement, however, created problems.\nCompany officials soon discovered that the zamindars\nwere in fact not investing in the improvement of land.\nThe revenue that had been fixed was so high that the\nzamindars found it difficult to pay. Anyone who failed to\npay the revenue lost his zamindari. Numerous zamindaris\nwere sold off at auctions organised by the Company.\nBy the first decade of the nineteenth century the\nsituation changed. The prices in the market rose and\ncultivation slowly expanded. This meant an increase in\nthe income of the zamindars but no gain for the\nCompany since it could not increase a revenue demand\nthat had been fixed permanently\nEven then the zamindars did not have an interest in\nimproving the land. Some had lost their lands in the\nearlier years of the settlement; others now saw the\npossibility of earning without the trouble and risk of\ninvestment. As long as the zamindars could give out the\nland to tenants and get rent, they were not interested in\nimproving the land.",

To pay the rent he had to often take a loan\nfrom the moneylender, and when he failed to pay the\nrent he was evicted from the land he had cultivated\nfor generations.\nA new system is devised\nBy the early nineteenth century many of the Company\nofficials were convinced that the system of revenue\nhad to be changed again. How could revenues be fixed\npermanently at a time when the Company needed\nmore money to meet its expenses of administration\nand trade?\nIn the North Wester n Provinces of the Bengal\nPresidency (most of this area is now in Uttar Pradesh),\nan Englishman called Holt Mackenzie devised the new\nsystem which came into effect in 1822. He felt that\nthe village was an important social institution in north\nIndian society and needed to be preserved. Under\nhis directions, collectors went from village to village,\ninspecting the land, measuring the fields, and recording\nthe customs and rights of different groups. The\nestimated revenue of each plot within a village\nwas added up to calculate the revenue that each\nvillage (mahal) had to pay. This demand was to be\nrevised periodically, not permanently fixed. The charge\nof collecting the revenue and paying it to the Company\nwas given to the village headman, rather than the\nzamindar. This system came to be known as the\nmahalwari settlement.\nThe Munro system\nIn the British territories in the south there was a similar\nmove away from the idea of Permanent Settlement. The\nnew system that was devised came to be known as the\nryotwar (or ryotwari ). It was tried on a small scale by\nCaptain Alexander Read in some of the areas that were\ntaken over by the Company after the wars with Tipu\nSultan. Subsequently developed by Thomas Munro, this\nsystem was gradually extended all over south India.\nRead and Munro felt that in the south there were no\ntraditional zamindars. The settlement, they argued, had\nto be made directly with the cultivators (ryots) who had\ntilled the land for generations. Their fields had to be\ncarefully and separately surveyed before the revenue\nassessment was made. Munro thought that the British\nRULING THE COUNTRYSIDE\nMahal – In British\nrevenue records mahal\nis a revenue estate\nwhich may be a village\nor a group of villages.",

Do you know how this colour was produced?\nThe blue that you see in these prints was produced\nfrom a plant called indigo. It is likely that the blue dye\nused in the Morris prints in nineteenth-century Britain\nwas manufactured from indigo plants cultivated in India.\nFor India was the biggest supplier of indigo in the world\nat that time.\nWhy the demand for Indian indigo?\nThe indigo plant grows primarily in the tropics. By the\nthirteenth century Indian indigo was being used by cloth\nmanufacturers in Italy, France and Britain to dye cloth.\nHowever, only small amounts of Indian indigo reached\nthe European market and its price was very high.\nEuropean cloth manufacturers therefore had to depend\non another plant called woad to make violet and blue\ndyes. Being a plant of the temperate zones, woad was\nmore easily available in Europe. It was grown in northern\nItaly, southern France and in parts of Germany and\nBritain. Worried by the competition from indigo, woad\nproducers in Europe pressurised their governments to\nban the import of indigo.\nCloth dyers, however, preferred indigo as a dye. Indigo\nproduced a rich blue colour, whereas the dye from woad\nwas pale and dull. By the seventeenth century, European\ncloth producers persuaded their governments to relax\nthe ban on indigo import. The French began cultivating\nindigo in St Domingue in the Caribbean islands, the\nPortuguese in Brazil, the English in Jamaica, and the\nSpanish in Venezuela. Indigo plantations also came up\nin many parts of North America.\nBy the end of the eighteenth century, the demand for\nIndian indigo grew further. Britain began to industrialise,\nand its cotton production expanded dramatically, creating\nan enormous new demand for cloth dyes. While the\ndemand for indigo increased, its existing supplies from\nthe West Indies and America collapsed for a variety of\nreasons. Between 1783 and 1789 the production of\nindigo in the world fell by half. Cloth dyers in Britain\nnow desperately looked for new sources of indigo supply.\nFrom where could this indigo be procured?\nBritain turns to India\nFaced with the rising demand for indigo in Europe, the\nCompany in India looked for ways to expand the area\nunder indigo cultivation.\nPlantation – A\nlarge farm operated\nby a planter\nemploying various\nforms of forced\nlabour.

By 1810, the\nproportion had gone up to\n95 per cent.\nAs the indigo trade\ngrew, commercial agents\nand officials of the\nCompany began investing\nin indigo production. Over\nthe years many Company\nofficials left their jobs to\nlook after their indigo\nbusiness.

He either bought the land or rented it from\nother zamindars and produced indigo by directly\nemploying hired labourers.\nThe problem with nij cultivation\nThe planters found it difficult to expand the area under\nnij cultivation. Indigo could be cultivated only on fertile\nlands, and these were all already densely populated.\nOnly small plots scattered over the landscape could be\nacquired.

They do so only at times.\nIn 1859, the indigo ryots felt that they had the\nsupport of the local zamindars and village headmen in\ntheir rebellion against the planters. In many villages,\nheadmen who had been forced to sign indigo contracts,\nmobilised the indigo peasants and fought pitched\nbattles with the lathiyals. In other places even the\nzamindars went around villages urging the ryots to\nresist the planters. These zamindars were unhappy with\nthe increasing power of the planters and angry at being\nforced by the planters to give them land on long leases.\nThe indigo peasants also imagined that the British\ngovernment would support them in their struggle\nagainst the planters. After the Revolt of 1857 the\nBritish government was particularly worried about the\npossibility of another popular rebellion.

This was done on small patches of land,\nmostly in forests. The cultivators cut the treetops to\nallow sunlight to reach the ground, and burnt the\nvegetation on the land to clear it for cultivation. They\nspread the ash from the firing, which contained potash,\nto fertilise the soil. They used the axe to cut trees and\nthe hoe to scratch the soil in order to prepare it for\ncultivation. They broadcast the seeds, that is, scattered\nthe seeds on the field instead of ploughing the land\nand sowing the seeds. Once the crop was ready and\nharvested, they moved to another field. A field that had\nbeen cultivated once was left fallow for several years,\nShifting cultivators were found in the hilly and\nforested tracts of north-east and central India. The lives\nof these tribal people depended on free movement within\nforests and on being able to use the land and forests\nfor growing their crops. That is the only way they could\npractise shifting cultivation.\nSome were hunters and gatherers\nIn many regions tribal groups lived by hunting animals\nand gathering forest produce. They saw forests as\nessential for survival. The Khonds were such a\ncommunity living in the forests of Orissa. They regularly\nwent out on collective hunts and then divided the\nmeat amongst themselves. They ate fruits and roots\ncollected from the forest\nand cooked food with the\noil they extracted from\nthe seeds of the sal and\nmahua. They used many\nforest shrubs and herbs\nfor medicinal purposes,\nand sold forest produce in\nthe local markets. The\nlocal weavers and leather\nworkers turned to the\nKhonds when they needed\nsupplies of kusum and\npalash flowers to colour\ntheir clothes and leather.\nFallow – A field left\nuncultivated for a while\nso that the soil recovers\nfertility\nSal – A tree\nMahua – A flower that\nis eaten or used to make\nalcohol",

At times they\nexchanged goods – getting what\nthey needed in return for their\nvaluable forest produce. At other\ntimes they bought goods with the\nsmall amount of earnings they\nhad. Some of them did odd jobs\nin the villages, carrying loads or\nbuilding roads, while others\nlaboured in the fields of peasants\nand farmers. When supplies of\nforest produce shrank, tribal\npeople had to increasingly\nwander around in search of work\nas labourers. But many of\nthem – like the Baigas of central\nIndia – were reluctant to do\nwork for others. The Baigas saw\nthemselves as people of the\nforest, who could only live on the\nproduce of the forest. It was\nbelow the dignity of a Baiga to\nbecome a labourer.\nTribal groups often needed to\nbuy and sell in order to be able\nto get the goods that were not produced within the\nlocality. This led to their dependence on traders and\nmoneylenders. Traders came around with things for\nsale, and sold the goods at high prices. Moneylenders\ngave loans with which the tribals met their cash needs,\nadding to what they earned. But the interest charged\non the loans was usually very high. So for the tribals,\nmarket and commerce often meant debt and poverty.\nThey therefore came to see the moneylender and trader\nas evil outsiders and the cause of their misery.\nSome herded animals\nMany tribal groups lived by herding and rearing animals.\nThey were pastoralists who moved with their herds of\ncattle or sheep according to the seasons. When the grass\nin one place was exhausted, they moved to another area.\nThe Van Gujjars of the Punjab hills and the Labadis of\nAndhra Pradesh were cattle herders, the Gaddis of Kulu\nwere shepherds, and the Bakarwals of Kashmir reared\ngoats.

He writes:\nIn Chait women went to clearings to ... cut stalks that were already reaped;\nmen cut large trees and go for their ritual hunt. The hunt began at full moon\nfrom the east. Traps of bamboo were used for hunting. The women gathered\nfruits like sago, tamarind and mushroom. Baiga women can only gather roots\nor kanda and mahua seeds. Of all the adivasis in Central India, the Baigas\nwere known as the best hunters … In Baisakh the firing of the forest took\nplace, the women gathered unburnt wood to burn. Men continued to hunt,\nbut nearer their villages. In Jeth sowing took place and hunting still went on.\nFrom Asadh to Bhadon the men worked in the fields. In Kuar the first fruits of\nbeans were ripened and in Kartik kutki became ripe. In Aghan every crop was\nready and in Pus winnowing took place.\nPus was also the time for dances and\nmarriages.

So changes in forest laws had\na considerable effect on tribal lives. The British extended\ntheir control over all forests and declared that forests\nwere state property. Some forests were classified as\nReserved Forests for they produced timber which the\nBritish wanted. In these forests people were not allowed\nto move freely, practise jhum cultivation, collect fruits,\nor hunt animals. How were jhum cultivators to survive\nin such a situation? Many were therefore forced to move\nto other areas in search of work and livelihood.\nBut once the British stopped the tribal people from\nliving inside forests, they faced a problem. From where\nwould the Forest Department get its labour to cut trees\nfor railway sleepers and to transport logs?\nColonial officials came up with a solution. They\ndecided that they would give jhum cultivators small\npatches of land in the forests and allow them to cultivate\nthese on the condition that those who lived in the\nvillages would have to provide labour to the Forest\nDepartment and look after the forests. So in many\nregions the Forest Department established forest\nvillages to ensure a regular supply of cheap labour.\n“In this land of the English how hard it is to live”\nIn the1930s Verrier Elwin visited the land of the Baigas – a tribal group in\ncentral India.

The\ntraders dealing in silk sent in their\nagents who gave loans to the tribal\npeople and collected the cocoons.\nThe growers were paid Rs 3 to Rs 4\nfor a thousand cocoons. These\nwere then exported to\nBurdwan or Gaya where\nthey were sold at five\ntimes the price. The\nmiddlemen – so called\nbecause they arranged\ndeals between the\nexporters and silk\ngrowers – made huge\nprofits. The silk growers\nearned very little.\nUnderstandably, many\ntribal groups saw the\nmarket and the traders\nas their main enemies.",

The son of a poor\nfather, he grew up around the forests of Bohonda,\ngrazing sheep, playing the flute, and dancing in the\nlocal akhara. Forced by poverty, his father had to move\nfrom place to place looking for work. As an adolescent,\nBirsa heard tales of the Munda uprisings of the past\nand saw the sirdars (leaders) of the community urging\nthe people to revolt. They talked of a golden age when the\nMundas had been free of the oppression of dikus, and\nsaid there would be a time when the ancestral right of\nthe community would be restored. They saw themselves\nas the descendants of the original settlers of the region,\nfighting for their land (mulk ki larai), reminding people\nof the need to win back their kingdom.\nBirsa went to the local missionary school, and\nlistened to the sermons of missionaries. There too he\nheard it said that it was possible for the Mundas to\nattain the Kingdom of Heaven, and regain their lost\nrights. This would be possible if they became good\nChristians and gave up their “bad practices”. Later Birsa\nalso spent some time in the company of a prominent\nVaishnav preacher. He wore the sacred thread, and\nbegan to value the importance of purity and piety.\nBirsa was deeply influenced by many of the ideas he\ncame in touch with in his growing-up years. His\nmovement was aimed at reforming tribal society. He\nurged the Mundas to give up drinking liquor, clean their\nvillage, and stop believing in witchcraft and sorcery. But\nwe must remember that Birsa also turned against\nmissionaries and Hindu landlords. He saw them as\noutside forces that were ruining the Munda way of life.\nIn 1895 Birsa urged his followers to recover their\nglorious past. He talked of a golden age in the past – a\nsatyug (the age of truth) – when Mundas lived a good\nlife, constructed embankments, tapped natural springs,\nplanted trees and orchards, practised cultivation to\nearn their living. They did not kill their brethren and\nrelatives. They lived honestly. Birsa also wanted people\nto once again work on their land, settle down and\ncultivate their fields.\nWhat worried British officials most was the political\naim of the Birsa movement, for it wanted to drive out\nmissionaries, moneylenders, Hindu landlords, and the\ngovernment and set up a Munda Raj with Birsa at\nits head. The movement identified all these forces as\nthe cause of the misery the Mundas were suffering.\nVaishnav – Worshippers\nof Vishnu\n‘Blood trickles from\nmy shoulders’\nThe songs the Mundas\nsang bemoaned their\nmisery.\nAlas! under [the\ndrudgery of] forced\nlabour\nBlood trickles from\nmy shoulders\nDay and night the\nemissary from the\nzamindars,\nAnnoys and irritates\nme, day and night I\ngroan\nAlas!

They arrested Birsa in 1895, convicted him on\ncharges of rioting and jailed him for two years.\nWhen Birsa was released in 1897 he began touring\nthe villages to gather support. He used traditional\nsymbols and language to rouse people, urging them to\ndestroy “Ravana” (dikus and the Europeans) and\nestablish a kingdom under his leadership. Birsa’s\nfollowers began targeting the symbols of diku and\nEuropean power. They attacked police stations and\nchurches, and raided the property of moneylenders and\nzamindars. They raised the white flag as a symbol of\nBirsa Raj.\nIn 1900 Birsa died of cholera and the movement\nfaded out. However, the movement was significant\nin at least two ways. First – it forced the colonial\ngovernment to introduce laws so that the land of the\ntribals could not be easily taken over by dikus.\nSecond – it showed once again that the tribal people\nhad the capacity to protest against injustice and\nexpress their anger against colonial rule.

They\nthought the disturbance caused by the issue of the\ncartridges would die down. But Bahadur Shah Zafar’s\ndecision to bless the rebellion changed the entire situation\ndramatically. Often when people see an alternative\npossibility they feel inspired and enthused. It gives them\nthe courage, hope and confidence to act.\nThe rebellion spreads\nAfter the British were routed from Delhi, there was no\nuprising for almost a week. It took that much time for\nnews to travel. Then, a spurt of mutinies began.\nRegiment after regiment mutinied and took off to join\nother troops at nodal points like Delhi, Kanpur and\nLucknow. After them, the people of the towns and villages\nalso rose up in rebellion and rallied around local leaders,\nzamindars and chiefs who were prepared to establish their\nauthority and fight the British. Nana Saheb, the adopted son\nof the late Peshwa Baji Rao who lived near Kanpur, gathered\narmed forces and expelled the British garrison from the city.\nHe proclaimed himself Peshwa. He declared that he was a\ngovernor under Emperor\nBahadur Shah Zafar. In\nLucknow, Birjis Qadr, the\nson of the deposed Nawab\nWajid Ali Shah, was\nproclaimed the new\nNawab.

      "chunk_text": "OUR PASTS – III 62\nThe Khurda Uprising – A Case Study\nMuch before the event of 1857, there had taken place another event of a similar nature at\na place called Khurda in 1817. Here, it would be instructive for us to study that event and\nreflect on how resentment against the colonial policies of the British had been building up\nsince the beginning of the 19th century in different parts of the country.\nKhurda, a small kingdom built up in the late 16th century in the south-eastern part of\nOdisha, was a populous and well-cultivated territory consisting of 105 garhs, 60 large and\n1109 small villages at the beginning of the 19th century. Its king, Raja Birakishore Dev had\nto earlier give up the possession of four parganas, the superintendence of the Jagannath\nTemple and the administration of fourteen garjats (Princely States) to the Marathas under\ncompulsion. His son and successor, Mukunda Dev II was greatly disturbed with this loss of\nfortune. Therefore, sensing an opportunity in the Anglo-Maratha conflict, he had entered\ninto negotiations with the British to get back his lost territories and the rights over the\nJagannath Temple. But after the occupation of Odisha in 1803, the British showed no\ninclination to oblige him on either score. Consequently, in alliance with other feudatory\nchiefs of Odisha and secret support of the Marathas, he tried to assert his rights by force.\nThis led to his deposition and annexation of his territories by the British. As a matter of\nconsolation, he was only given the rights of management of the Jagannath Temple with a\ngrant amounting to a mere one-tenth of the revenue of his former estate and his residence\nwas fixed at Puri. This unfair settlement commenced an era of oppressive foreign rule in\nOdisha, which paved the way for a serious armed uprising in 1817.\nSoon after taking over Khurda, the British followed a policy of resuming service tenures.\nIt bitterly affected the lives of the ex-militia of the state, the Paiks. The severity of the\nmeasure was compounded on account of an unreasonable increase in the demand of revenue\nand also the oppressive ways of its collection. Consequently, there was large scale desertion\nof people from Khurda between 1805 and 1817. Yet, the British went for a series of short-\nterm settlements, each time increasing the demands, not recognising either the productive\ncapacity of the land or the paying capacity of the ryots. No leniency was shown even in case\nof natural calamities, which Odisha was frequently prone to. Rather, lands of defaulters\nwere sold off to scheming revenue officials or speculators from Bengal.\nThe hereditary Military Commander of the deposed king, Jagabandhu Bidyadhar\nMahapatra Bhramarabar Rai or Buxi Jagabandhu as he was popularly known, was one\namong the dispossessed land-holders. He had in effect become a beggar, and for nearly two\nyears survived on voluntary contributions from the people of Khurda before deciding to\nfight for their grievances as well as his own. Over the years, what had added to these\ngrievances were (a) the introduction of sicca rupee (silver currency) in the region, (b) the\ninsistence on payment of revenue in the new currency, (c) an unprecedented rise in the\nprices of food-stuff and salt, which had become far-fetched following the introduction of\nsalt monopoly because of which the traditional salt makers of Odisha were deprived of\nmaking salt, and (d) the auction of local estates in Calcutta, which brought in absentee\nlandlords from Bengal to Odisha. Besides, the insensitive and corrupt police system also\nmade the situation worse for the armed uprising to take a sinister shape.\nThe uprising was set off on 29 March 1817 as the Paiks attacked the police station and\nother government establishments at Banpur killing more than a hundred men and took\naway a large amount of government money. Soon its ripples spread in different directions\nwith Khurda becoming its epicenter. The zamindars and ryots alike joined the Paiks with\nenthusiasm. Those who did not, were taken to task. A ‘no-rent campaign’ was also started.\nThe British tried to dislodge the Paiks from their entrenched position but failed. On 14\n2019-200",

      "chunk_text": "63 WHEN PEOPLE REBEL\nApril 1817, Buxi Jagabandhu, leading five to ten thousand Paiks and men of the Kandh\ntribe seized Puri and declared the hesitant king, Mukunda Dev II as their ruler. The\npriests of the Jagannath Temple also extended the Paiks their full support.\nSeeing the situation going out of hand, the British clamped Martial Law. The King was\nquickly captured and sent to prison in Cuttack with his son. The Buxi with his close associate,\nKrushna Chandra Bhramarabar Rai, tried to cut off all communications between Cuttack\nand Khurda as the uprising spread to the southern and the north-western parts of Odisha.\nConsequently, the British sent Major-General Martindell to clear off the area from the\nclutches of the Paiks while at the same time announcing rewards for the arrest of Buxi\njagabandhu and his associates. In the ensuing operation hundreds of Paiks were killed,\nmany fled to deep jungles and some returned home under a scheme of amnesty. Thus by\nMay 1817 the uprising was mostly contained.\nHowever, outside Khurda it was sustained by Buxi Jagabandhu with the help of supporters\nlike the Raja of Kujung and the unflinching loyalty of the Paiks until his surrender in May\n1825. On their part, the British henceforth adopted a policy of ‘leniency, indulgence and\nforbearance’ towards the people of Khurda. The price of salt was reduced and necessary\nreforms were made in the police and the justice systems. Revenue officials found to be\ncorrupt were dismissed from service and former land-holders were restored to their lands.\nThe son of the king of Khurda, Ram Chandra Dev III was allowed to move to Puri and\ntake charge of the affairs of the Jagannath Temple with a grant of rupees twenty-four\nthousand.\nIn sum, it was the first such popular anti-British armed uprising in Odisha, which had\nfar reaching effect on the future of British administration in that part of the country. To\nmerely call it a ‘Paik Rebellion’ will thus be an understatement.\nELSEWHERE\nFor a Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace\nWhile the revolt was spreading in India\nin 1857, a massive popular uprising\nwas raging in the southern parts of\nChina. It had started in 1850 and could\nbe suppressed only by the mid-1860s.\nThousands of labouring, poor people\nwere led by Hong Xiuquan to fight for\nthe establishment of the Heavenly\nKingdom of Great Peace. This was known\nas the Taiping Rebellion.\nHong Xiuquan was a convert to\nChristianity and was against the\ntraditional religions practised in China such as Confucianism and Buddhism. The rebels of\nTaiping wanted to establish a kingdom where a form of Christianity was practised, where no\none held any private property, where there was no difference between social classes and between\nmen and women, where consumption of opium, tobacco, alcohol, and activities like gambling,\nprostitution, slavery, were prohibited.\nThe British and French armed forces operating in China helped the emperor of the Qing\ndynasty to put down the Taiping Rebellion.",

Dutch and English trading ships began using the port from the\nearly seventeenth century. Its importance declined in the eighteenth century.\nThis chapter tells the story of the crafts and industries of India during\nBritish rule by focusing on two industries, namely, textiles and\niron and steel. Both these industries were crucial for the industrial\nrevolution in the modern world. Mechanised production of cotton\ntextiles made Britain the foremost industrial nation in the nineteenth\ncentury. And when its iron and steel industry started growing from\nthe 1850s, Britain came to be known as the “workshop of the world”.\nThe industrialisation of Britain had a close connection with the\nconquest and colonisation of India. You have seen (Chapter 2) how\nthe English East India Company’s interest in trade led to occupation\nof territory, and how the pattern of trade changed over the decades.\nIn the late eighteenth century the Company was buying goods in India\nand exporting them to England and Europe, making profit through\nthis sale. With the growth of industrial production, British\nindustrialists began to see India as a vast market for their industrial\nproducts, and over time manufactured goods from Britain began\nflooding India. How did this affect Indian crafts and industries?\nThis is the question we will explore in this chapter.\n2019-200",

Indian\ntextiles had long been renowned\nboth for their fine quality and\nexquisite craftsmanship. They\nwere extensively traded in\nSoutheast Asia (Java, Sumatra\nand Penang) and West and\nCentral Asia. From the sixteenth\ncentury European trading\ncompanies began buying Indian\ntextiles for sale in Europe.\nMemories of this flourishing\ntrade and the craftsmanship of\nIndian weavers is preserved in\nmany words still current in\nEnglish and other languages. It\nis interesting to trace the origin of such words, and see\nwhat they tell us.\nWords tell us histories\nEuropean traders first encountered fine cotton cloth\nfrom India carried by Arab merchants in Mosul in\npresent-day Iraq. So they began referring to all finely\nwoven textiles as “muslin” – a word that acquired wide\ncurrency. When the Portuguese first came to India in\nsearch of spices they landed in Calicut on the Kerala\ncoast in south-west India. The cotton textiles which\nthey took back to Europe, along with the spices, came\nto be called “calico” (derived from Calicut), and\nsubsequently calico became the general name for all\ncotton textiles.\nThere are many other words which point to the\npopularity of Indian textiles in Western markets.

When the wheel\nwas turned all the\nspindles rotated.\nIndian textiles in European markets\nBy the early eighteenth century, worried by the\npopularity of Indian textiles, wool and silk makers in\nEngland began protesting against the import of Indian\ncotton textiles. In 1720, the British government enacted\na legislation banning the use of printed cotton textiles\n– chintz – in England. Interestingly, this Act was known\nas the Calico Act.\nAt this time textile industries had just begun to\ndevelop in England. Unable to compete with Indian\ntextiles, English producers wanted a secure market\nwithin the country by preventing the entry of Indian\ntextiles. The first to grow under government protection\nwas the calico printing industry. Indian designs were\nnow imitated and printed in England on white muslin\nor plain unbleached Indian cloth.\nCompetition with Indian textiles also led to a search\nfor technological innovation in England. In 1764, the\nspinning jenny was invented by John Kaye which\nincreased the productivity of the traditional spindles.\nThe invention of the steam engine by Richard Arkwright\nin 1786 revolutionised cotton textile weaving. Cloth could\nnow be woven in immense quantities and cheaply too.\nHowever, Indian textiles continued to dominate world\ntrade till the end of the eighteenth century. European\ntrading companies – the Dutch, the French and the\nEnglish – made enormous profits out of this flourishing\ntrade. These companies purchased cotton and silk\ntextiles in India by importing silver. But as you know\n(Chapter 2), when the English East India Company\ngained political power in Bengal, it no longer had to\nimport precious metal to buy Indian goods. Instead, they\ncollected revenues from peasants and zamindars in\nIndia, and used this revenue to buy Indian textiles.\nFig. 7 Fig. 7 Fig. 7 Fig. 7 Fig. 7 – A sea view of the Dutch\nsettlement in Cochin, seventeenth\ncentury\nAs European trade expanded,\ntrading settlements were\nestablished at various ports.\nThe Dutch settlements in Cochin\ncame up in the seventeenth\ncentury.

A year later a mill\nwas established in Kanpur, in the United Provinces.\nGrowth of cotton mills led to a demand for labour.\nThousands of poor peasants, artisans and agricultural\nlabourers moved to the cities to work in the mills.\nIn the first few decades of its existence, the textile\nfactory industry in India faced many problems. It found\nit difficult to compete with the cheap textiles imported\nfrom Britain. In most countries, governments supported\nindustrialisation by imposing heavy duties on imports.\nThis eliminated competition and protected infant\nindustries. The colonial government in India usually\nrefused such protection to local industries. The first\nmajor spurt in the development of cotton factory\nproduction in India, therefore, was during the First\nWorld War when textile imports from Britain declined\nand Indian factories were called upon to produce cloth\nfor military supplies.\nThe sword of Tipu Sultan and\nWootz steel\nWe begin the story of Indian steel and iron metallurgy\nby recounting the famous story of Tipu Sultan who ruled\nMysore till 1799, fought four wars with the British\nand died fighting with his sword in his hand. Tipu’s\nlegendary swords are now part of valuable collections\nin museums in England. But do you know why the sword\nwas so special? The sword had an incredibly hard and\nsharp edge that could easily rip through the opponent’s\narmour. This quality of the sword came from a special\ntype of high carbon steel called Wootz which was\nproduced all over south India. Wootz steel when made\ninto swords produced a very sharp edge with a flowing\nwater pattern. This pattern came from very small carbon\ncrystals embedded in the iron.\nFrancis Buchanan who toured through Mysore in\n1800, a year after Tipu Sultan’s death, has left us an\naccount of the technique by which Wootz steel was\nproduced in many hundreds of smelting furnaces in\nMysore. In these furnaces, iron was mixed with charcoal\nand put inside small clay pots. Through an intricate\ncontrol of temperatures the smelters produced steel\ningots that were used for sword making not just in India\nbut in West and Central Asia too.

In the hot month of April, Charles Weld,\nan American geologist and Dorabji Tata, the eldest son of\nJamsetji Tata, were travelling in Chhattisgarh in search of\niron ore deposits. They had spent many months on a costly\nventure looking for sources of good iron ore to set up a\nmodern iron and steel plant in India. Jamsetji Tata had\ndecided to spend a large part of his fortune to build a big\niron and steel industry in India. But this could not be done\nwithout identifying the source of fine quality iron ore.\nOne day, after travelling for many hours in the forests,\nWeld and Dorabji came upon a small village and found a\ngroup of men and women carrying basketloads of iron ore.\nThese people were the Agarias. When asked where they had\nfound the iron ore, the Agarias pointed to a hill in the\ndistance. Weld and Dorabji reached the hill after an\nexhausting trek through dense forests. On exploring the hill\nthe geologist declared that they had at last found what they\nhad been looking for. Rajhara Hills had one of the finest ores\nin the world.\nBut there was a problem. The region was dry and water –\nnecessary for running the factory – was not to be found\nnearby. The Tatas had to continue their search for a more\nsuitable place to set up their factory.

The colonial state in India, keen to expand the market for\nBritish goods, was unwilling to support Indian industrialists. In Japan, the state\nencouraged the growth of industries.\nThe Meiji regime, which assumed power in Japan in 1868, believed that Japan\nneeded to industrialise in order to resist Western domination. So it initiated a series\nof measures to help industrialisation. Postal services, telegraph, railways, steam\npowered shipping were developed. The most advanced technology from the West\nwas imported and adapted to the needs of Japan. Foreign experts were brought to\ntrain Japanese professionals. Industrialists were provided with generous loans for\ninvestment by banks set up the government. Large industries were first started by\nthe government and then sold off at cheap rates to business families.\nIn India colonial domination created barriers to industrialisation. In Japan the\nfear of foreign conquest spurred industrialisation.

In this chapter we\nwill try and understand what implication it had for the\nlives of students. For, the British in India wanted not only\nterritorial conquest and control over revenues. They also felt\nthat they had a cultural mission: they had to “civilise the\nnatives”, change their customs and values.\nWhat changes were to be introduced? How were Indians\nto be educated, “civilised”, and made into what the British\nbelieved were “good subjects”? The British could find\nno simple answers to these questions. They continued to\nbe debated for many decades.\nHow the British saw Education\nLet us look at what the British thought and\ndid, and how some of the ideas of education\nthat we now take for granted evolved in the\nlast two hundred years. In the process of this\nenquiry we will also see how Indians reacted\nto British ideas, and how they developed\ntheir own views about how Indians were to\nbe educated.\nThe tradition of Orientalism\nIn 1783, a person named William Jones\narrived in Calcutta. He had an appointment\nas a junior judge at the Supreme Court that\nthe Company had set up. In addition to being\nan expert in law, Jones was a linguist.

Soon he was studying ancient Indian texts on\nlaw, philosophy, religion, politics, morality, arithmetic,\nmedicine and the other sciences.\nJones discovered that his interests were shared by\nmany British officials living in Calcutta at the time.\nEnglishmen like Henry Thomas Colebrooke and Nathaniel\nHalhed were also busy discovering the ancient Indian\nheritage, mastering Indian languages and translating\nSanskrit and Persian works into English. Together with\nthem, Jones set up the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and\nstarted a journal called Asiatick Researches.\nJones and Colebrooke came to represent a particular\nattitude towards India. They shared a deep respect for\nancient cultures, both of India and the West. Indian\ncivilisation, they felt, had attained its glory in the ancient\npast, but had subsequently declined. In order to\nunderstand India it was necessary to discover the sacred\nand legal texts that were produced in the ancient period.\nFor only those texts could reveal the real ideas and laws\nof the Hindus and Muslims, and only a new study of these\ntexts could form the basis of future development in India.\nSo Jones and Colebrooke went about discovering\nancient texts, understanding their meaning, translating\nthem, and making their findings known to others. This\nproject, they believed, would not only help the British learn\nfrom Indian culture, but it would also help Indians\nrediscover their own heritage, and understand the lost\nglories of their past. In this process the British would become\nthe guardians of Indian culture as well as its masters.\nInfluenced by such ideas, many Company officials\nargued that the British ought to promote Indian rather\nthan Western learning. They felt that institutions should\nbe set up to encourage the study of ancient Indian texts\nand teach Sanskrit and Persian literature and poetry.\nThe officials also thought that Hindus and Muslims\nought to be taught what they were already familiar with,\nand what they valued and treasured, not subjects that\nwere alien to them. Only then, they believed, could the\nBritish hope to win a place in the hearts of the “natives”;\nonly then could the alien rulers expect to be respected by\ntheir subjects.\nWith this object in view a madrasa was set up in\nCalcutta in 1781 to promote the study of Arabic, Persian\nand Islamic law; and the Hindu College was established\nin Benaras in 1791 to encourage the study of ancient\nSanskrit texts that would be useful for the administration\nof the country.\nMadrasa – An Arabic\nword for a place of\nlearning; any type of\nschool or college",

Many were very\nstrong in their criticism of the Orientalists.\n“Grave errors of the East”\nFrom the early nineteenth century many British officials\nbegan to criticise the Orientalist vision of learning. They\nsaid that knowledge of the East was full of errors and\nunscientific thought; Eastern literature was non-serious\nand light-hearted. So they argued that it was wrong on\nthe part of the British to spend so much effort in\nencouraging the study of Arabic and Sanskrit language\nand literature.\nJames Mill was one of those who attacked the\nOrientalists. The British effort, he declared, should not\nbe to teach what the natives wanted, or what they\nrespected, in order to please them and “win a place in\ntheir heart”. The aim of education ought to be to teach\nwhat was useful and practical. So Indians should be\nmade familiar with the scientific and technical advances\nthat the West had made, rather than with the poetry\nand sacred literature of the Orient.\nBy the 1830s the attack on the Orientalists became\nsharper. One of the most outspoken and influential of\nsuch critics of the time was Thomas Babington\nMacaulay. He saw India as an uncivilised country that\nneeded to be civilised.

Teaching of English could thus\nbe a way of civilising people, changing their tastes,\nvalues and culture.\nFollowing Macaulay’s minute, the English Education\nAct of 1835 was introduced.

European learning, it said, would enable\nIndians to recognise the advantages that flow from the\nexpansion of trade and commerce, and make them see\nthe importance of developing the resources of the\ncountry.

And if there were\nschools, what happened to these\nunder British rule?\nThe report of William Adam\nIn the 1830s, William Adam, a\nScottish missionary, toured\nthe districts of Bengal and\nBihar. He had been asked by the\nCompany to report on the progress of education in vernacular\nschools. The report Adam produced is interesting.\nAdam found that there were over 1 lakh pathshalas in\nBengal and Bihar. These were small institutions with no\nmore than 20 students each. But the total number of\nchildren being taught in these pathshalas was considerable\n– over 20 lakh. These institutions were set up by wealthy\npeople, or the local community. At times they were started\nby a teacher (guru).\nThe system of education was flexible. Few things that\nyou associate with schools today were present in the\npathshalas at the time. There were no fixed fee, no printed\nbooks, no separate school building, no benches or chairs,\nno blackboards, no system of separate classes, no roll-\ncall registers, no annual examinations, and no regular\ntime-table. In some places classes were held under a\nbanyan tree, in other places in the corner of a village\nshop or temple, or at the guru’s home. Fee depended on\nthe income of parents: the rich had to pay more than the\npoor. Teaching was oral, and the guru decided what to\nteach, in accordance with the needs of the students.\nStudents were not separated out into different classes:\nall of them sat together in one place. The guru interacted\nseparately with groups of children with different levels\nof learning.\nAdam discovered that this flexible system was suited\nto local needs. For instance, classes were not held during\nharvest time when rural children often worked in the\nfields. The pathshala started once again when the crops\nhad been cut and stored. This meant that even children\nof peasant families could study.",

So it allowed\nthe local pathshalas to function without much\ninterference. After 1854 the Company decided to\nimprove the system of vernacular education. It felt that\nthis could be done by introducing order within the\nsystem, imposing routines, establishing rules, ensuring\nregular inspections.\nHow was this to be done? What measures did\nthe Company undertake? It appointed a number of\ngovernment pandits, each in charge of looking after four\nto five schools. The task of the pandit was to visit the\npathshalas and try and improve the standard of teaching.\nEach guru was asked to submit periodic reports and\ntake classes according to a regular timetable. Teaching\nwas now to be based on textbooks and learning was\nto be tested through a system of annual examination.\nStudents were asked to pay a regular fee, attend regular\nclasses, sit on fixed seats, and obey the new rules\nof discipline.\nPathshalas which accepted the new rules were\nsupported through government grants. Those who were\nunwilling to work within the new system received no\ngovernment support. Over time gurus who wanted to\nretain their independence found it difficult to compete\nwith the government aided and regulated pathshalas.\nThe new rules and routines had another consequence.\nIn the earlier system children from poor peasant families\nhad been able to go to pathshalas, since the timetable\nwas flexible. The discipline of the new system demanded\nregular attendance, even during harvest time when\nchildren of poor families had to work in the fields.\nInability to attend school came to be seen as indiscipline,\nas evidence of the lack of desire to learn.\nThe Agenda for a National Education\nBritish officials were not the only people thinking about\neducation in India.

It made\nthem see Western civilisation as superior, and destroyed\nthe pride they had in their own culture. There was\npoison in this education, said Mahatma Gandhi, it was\nsinful, it enslaved Indians, it cast an evil spell on them.\nCharmed by the West, appreciating everything that\ncame fr om the West, Indians educated in these\ninstitutions began admiring British rule. Mahatma\nGandhi wanted an education that could help Indians\nrecover their sense of dignity and self-respect. During\nthe national movement he urged students to leave\neducational institutions in order to show to the British\nthat Indians were no longer willing to be enslaved.\nMahatma Gandhi strongly felt that Indian languages\nought to be the medium of teaching. Education in\nEnglish crippled Indians, distanced them from their\nown social surroundings, and made them “strangers in\ntheir own lands”. Speaking a foreign tongue, despising\nlocal culture, the English educated did not know how\nto relate to the masses.\nWestern education, Mahatma Gandhi said, focused\non reading and writing rather than oral knowledge;\nit valued textbooks rather than lived experience and\npractical knowledge. He\nargued that education\nought to develop a person’s\nmind and soul.

Child labour being widely\nprevalent, poor children could not be sent to school for their earning was critical for the\nsurvival of the family. The number of schools was also limited to those run by the Church\nor set up by wealthy individuals. It was only after the coming into force of the Education\nAct that schools were opened by the government and compulsory schooling was introduced.\nOne of the most important educational thinkers of the period was Thomas Arnold,\nwho became the headmaster of the private school Rugby. Favouring a secondary school\ncurriculum which had a detailed study of the Greek and Roman classics, written 2,000\nyears earlier, he said:\nIt has always seemed to me one of the great advantages of the course of study\ngenerally pursued in our English schools that it draws our minds so continually\nto dwell upon the past. Every day we are engaged in studying the languages, the\nhistory, and the thoughts of men who lived nearly or more than two thousand\nyears ago…\nArnold felt that a study of the classics disciplined the mind. In fact, most educators of the\ntime believed that such a discipline was necessary because young people were naturally\nsavage and needed to be controlled. To become civilised adults, they needed to understand\nsociety’s notions of right and wrong, proper and improper behaviour. Education, especially\none which disciplined their minds, was meant to guide them on this path.\nCan you suggest how such ideas might have influenced thinking about education of the\npoor in England and of the “natives” in the colonies?\n2019-200",

Brahmans and Kshatriyas considered\nthemselves as “upper castes”. Others, such as traders\nand moneylenders (often referred to as Vaishyas) were\nplaced after them. Then came peasants, and artisans\nsuch as weavers and potters (referred to as Shudras).\nAt the lowest rung were those who laboured to keep\ncities and villages clean or worked at jobs that upper\ncastes considered “polluting”, that is, it could lead to\nthe loss of caste status. The upper castes also treated\nmany of these groups at the bottom as “untouchable”.\nThey were not allowed to enter temples, draw water\nfrom the wells used by the upper castes, or bathe in\nponds where upper castes bathed. They were seen as\ninferior human beings.\nOver the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, many\nof these norms and perceptions slowly changed. Let us\nsee how this happened.\nWorking Towards Change\nFrom the early nineteenth century, we find debates and\ndiscussions about social customs and practices taking on\na new character. One important reason for this was\nthe development of new forms of communication. For the\nfirst time, books, newspapers, magazines, leaflets and\npamphlets were printed. These were far cheaper and\nfar more accessible than the manuscripts that you have\nread about in Class VII. Therefore ordinary people could\nread these, and many of them could also write and\nexpress their ideas in their own languages. All kinds of\nissues – social, political, economic and religious – could\nnow be debated and discussed by men (and sometimes\nby women as well) in the new cities. The discussions\ncould reach out to a wider public, and could become\nlinked to movements for social change.\nThese debates were often initiated by Indian reformers\nand reform groups. One such reformer was Raja\nRammohun Roy (1772-1833). He founded a reform\nassociation known as the Brahmo Sabha (later known\nas the Brahmo Samaj) in Calcutta. People such as\nRammohun Roy are described as reformers because they\nfelt that changes were necessary in society, and unjust\npractices needed to be done away with. They thought\nthat the best way to ensure such changes was by\npersuading people to give up old practices and adopt a\nnew way of life.\nWOMEN, CASTE AND REFORM",

Orthodox Muslims were also worried about\nthe impact of these changes.\nAs you can see, by the end of the nineteenth century,\nwomen themselves were actively working for reform.\nThey wrote books, edited magazines, founded schools\nand training centres, and set up women’s associations.\nFrom the early twentieth century, they formed political\npressure groups to push through laws for female suffrage\n(the right to vote) and better health care and education\nfor women. Some of them joined various kinds of\nnationalist and socialist movements from the 1920s.\nIn the twentieth century, leaders such as\nJawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose lent their\nsupport to demands for greater equality and freedom\nfor women. Nationalist leaders promised that there\nwould be full suffrage for all men and women after\nIndependence.

People challenged\nanother established custom – that of child\nmarriage. There were a number of Indian\nlegislators in the Central Legislative Assembly\nwho fought to make a law preventing child\nmarriage. In 1929 the Child Marriage\nRestraint Act was passed without the kind of\nbitter debates and struggles that earlier laws\nhad seen. According to the Act no man below\nthe age of 18 and woman below the age of\n16 could marry. Subsequently these limits\nwere raised to 21 for men and 18 for women.\nCaste and Social Reform\nSome of the social reformers we have been discussing\nalso criticised caste inequalities. Rammohun Roy\ntranslated an old Buddhist text that was critical of\ncaste. The Prarthana Samaj adhered to the tradition of\nBhakti that believed in spiritual equality of all castes.\nIn Bombay, the Paramhans Mandali was founded in\n1840 to work for the abolition of caste. Many of these\nreformers and members of reform associations were\npeople of upper castes. Often, in secret meetings, these\nreformers would violate caste taboos on food and touch,\nin an effort to get rid of the hold of caste prejudice in\ntheir lives.\nThere were also others who questioned the injustices\nof the caste social order. During the course of the\nnineteenth century, Christian missionaries began\nsetting up schools for tribal groups and “lower”-caste\nchildren. These children were thus equipped with some\nresources to make their way into a changing world.\nAt the same time, the poor began leaving their\nvillages to look for jobs that were opening up in the\ncities.

      "chunk_text": "105 WOMEN, CASTE AND REFORM\nThe Non-Brahman movement\nIn the early twentieth century, the non-Brahman\nmovement started. The initiative came from those\nnon-Brahman castes that had acquired access to\neducation, wealth and influence. They argued that\nBrahmans were heirs of Aryan invaders from the\nnorth who had conquered southern lands from\nthe original inhabitants of the region – the indigenous\nDravidian races. They also challenged Brahmanical\nclaims to power.\nE.V. Ramaswamy Naicker, or Periyar, as he\nwas called, came from a middle-class family.\nInterestingly, he had been an ascetic in his early\nlife and had studied Sanskrit scriptures carefully.\nLater, he became a member of the Congress, only to\nleave it in disgust when he found that at a feast\norganised by nationalists, seating arrangements\nfollowed caste distinctions – that is, the lower castes\nwere made to sit at a distance from the upper castes.\nConvinced that untouchables had to fight for their\ndignity, Periyar founded the Self Respect Movement.\nHe argued that untouchables were the true\nupholders of an original Tamil and Dravidian culture\nwhich had been subjugated by Brahmans. He felt\nthat all religious authorities saw social divisions\nand inequality as God-given. Untouchables had to\nfree themselves, therefore, from all religions in order\nto achieve social equality.\nPeriyar was an outspoken critic of Hindu scriptures,\nespecially the Codes of Manu, the ancient lawgiver,\nand the Bhagavad Gita and the Ramayana. He said\nthat these texts had been used to establish the\nauthority of Brahmans over lower castes and the\ndomination of men over women.\nThese assertions did not go unchallenged. The\nforceful speeches, writings and movements of lower-\ncaste leaders did lead to rethinking and some self-\ncriticism among upper-caste nationalist leaders. But\northodox Hindu society also reacted by founding\nSanatan Dharma Sabhas and the Bharat Dharma\nMahamandal in the north, and associations like the\nBrahman Sabha in Bengal. The object of these\nassociations was to uphold caste distinctions as a\ncornerstone of Hinduism, and show how this was\nsanctified by scriptures. Debates and struggles over\ncaste continued beyond the colonial period and are\nstill going on in our own times.\nPeriyar on women\nPeriyar wrote:\nOnly with the arrival of\nwords such as Thara\nMukurtham our women\nhad become puppets in\nthe hands of their\nhusbands … we ended\nup with such fathers\nwho advise their\ndaughters ... that they\nhad been gifted away\nto their husbands and\nthey belong to their\nhusband’s place.

It critically drew upon the ideals of religions – especially of\nHinduism and Christianity – looking at their negative and\npositive dimensions.\nDerozio and Young Bengal\nHenry Louis Vivian Derozio, a teacher at Hindu College, Calcutta, in the\n1820s, promoted radical ideas and encouraged his pupils to question all\nauthority. Referred to as the Young Bengal Movement, his students attacked\ntradition and custom, demanded education for women and campaigned for\nthe freedom of thought and expression.\nThe Ramakrishna Mission and Swami Vivekananda\nNamed after Ramakrishna Paramhansa, Swami Vivekananda’s guru, the\nRamakrishna Mission stressed the ideal of salvation through social service\nand selfless action.\nSwami Vivekananda (1863-1902), whose original name was Narendra\nNath Dutta, combined the simple teachings of Sri Ramakrishna with his\nwell founded modern outlook and spread them all over the world. After\nhearing him in the World Parliament of Religions at Chicago in 1893, the\nNew York Herald reported, “We feel how foolish it is to send missionaries\nto this learned nation”. Indeed, Swami Vivekananda was the first Indian in\nmodern times, who re-established the spiritual pre-eminence of the Vedanta\nphilosophy on a global scale. But his mission was not simply to talk of\nreligion. He was extremely pained at the poverty and the misery of his\ncountry men. He firmly believed that any reform could become successful only by uplifting the\ncondition of the masses. Therefore, his clarion call to the people of India was to rise above the\nnarrow confines of their ‘religion of the kitchen’ and come together in the service of the nation.\nBy sending out this call he made a signal contribution to the nascent nationalism of India. His\nsense of nationalism was, however, not narrow in its conception. He was convinced that many\nof the problems facing the mankind could only be overcome if the nations of the world come\ntogether on an equal footing. Therefore, his exhortation to the youth was to unite on the basis\nof a common spiritual heritage. In this exhortation he became truly ‘the symbol of a new spirit\nand a source of strength for the future’.\nThe Prarthana Samaj\nEstablished in 1867 at Bombay, the Prarthana Samaj sought to remove caste restrictions, abolish\nchild marriage, encourage the education of women, and end the ban on widow remarriage. Its\nreligious meetings drew upon Hindu, Buddhist and Christian texts.\nThe Veda Samaj\nEstablished in Madras (Chennai) in 1864, the Veda Samaj was inspired by the Brahmo Samaj. It\nworked to abolish caste distinctions and promote widow remarriage and women’s education.\nIts members believed in one God. They condemned the superstitions and rituals of orthodox\nHinduism.",

      "chunk_text": "OUR PASTS – III 110\nThe Emergence of Nationalism\nThe above-mentioned developments led the people to\nask a crucial question: what is this country of India\nand for whom is it meant? The answer that gradually\nemerged was: India was the people of India – all the\npeople irrespective of class, colour, caste, creed, language,\nor gender. And the country, its resources and systems,\nwere meant for all of them. With this answer came the\nawareness that the British were exercising control over\nthe resources of India and the lives of its people, and\nuntil this control was ended India could not be for Indians.\nThis consciousness began to be clearly stated by the\npolitical associations formed after 1850, especially those\nthat came into being in the 1870s and 1880s. Most of\nthese were led by English-educated professionals such\nas lawyers. The more important ones were the Poona\nSarvajanik Sabha, the Indian Association, the Madras\nMahajan Sabha, the Bombay Presidency Association,\nand of course the Indian National Congress.\nNote the name, “Poona Sarvajanik Sabha”. The literal\nmeaning of “sarvajanik” is “of or for all the people” (sarva =\nall + janik = of the people). Though many of these\nassociations functioned in specific parts of the country,\ntheir goals were stated as the goals of all the people\nof India, not those of any one region, community or\nclass. They worked with the idea that the people should\nbe sovereign – a modern consciousness and a key\nfeature of nationalism. In other words, they believed\nthat the Indian people should be empowered to take\ndecisions regarding their affairs.\nThe dissatisfaction with British rule intensified in\nthe 1870s and 1880s. The Arms Act was passed in 1878,\ndisallowing Indians from possessing arms. In the\nsame year the Vernacular Press Act was also enacted\nin an effort to silence those who were critical of the\ngovernment. The Act allowed the government to\nconfiscate the assets of newspapers including their\nprinting presses if the newspapers published anything\nthat was found “objectionable”. In 1883, there was a\nfurore over the attempt by the government to introduce\nthe Ilbert Bill. The bill provided for the trial of British\nor European persons by Indians, and sought equality\nbetween British and Indian judges in the country. But\nwhen white opposition forced the government to\nwithdraw the bill, Indians were enraged. The event\nhighlighted the racial attitudes of the British in India.\nSovereign – The capacity\nto act independently\nwithout outside\ninterference\n2019-200",

During this period it demanded a greater voice\nfor Indians in the government and in administration.\nIt wanted the Legislative Councils to be made more\nrepresentative, given more power, and introduced in\nprovinces where none existed. It demanded that Indians\nbe placed in high positions in the government. For this\npurpose it called for civil service examinations to be\nheld in India as well, not just in London.\nThe demand for Indianisation of the administration\nwas part of a movement against racisim, since most\nimportant jobs at the time were monopolised by white",

Since\nBritish officers were sending a major part of their large\nsalaries home, Indianisation, it was hoped, would also\nreduce the drain of wealth to England. Other demands\nincluded the separation of the judiciary from the\nexecutive, the repeal of the Arms Act and the freedom\nof speech and expression.\nThe early Congress also raised a number of economic\nissues. It declared that British rule had led to poverty and\nfamines: increase in the land revenue had impoverished\npeasants and zamindars, and exports of grains to Europe\nhad created food shortages. The Congress demanded\nreduction of revenue, cut in military expenditure, and\nmore funds for irrigation. It passed many resolutions\non the salt tax, treatment of Indian labourers abroad,\nand the sufferings of forest dwellers – caused by an\ninterfering forest administration. All this shows that\ndespite being a body of the educated elite, the Congress\ndid not talk only on behalf of professional groups,\nzamindars or industrialists.\nThe Moderate leaders wanted to develop public\nawareness about the unjust nature of British rule. They\npublished newspapers, wrote articles, and showed\nhow British rule was leading to the economic ruin\nof the country. They criticised British rule in their\nspeeches and sent representatives to different parts\nof the country to mobilise public opinion. They felt\nthat the British had respect for the ideals of freedom\nand justice, and so they would accept the just demands\nof Indians. What was necessary, therefore, was to\nexpress these demands, and make the government aware\nof the feelings of Indians.\n“Freedom is our birthright”\nBy the 1890s many Indians began to raise questions\nabout the political style of the Congress. In Bengal,\nMaharashtra and Punjab, leaders such as Bepin\nChandra Pal, Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Lala Lajpat Rai\nwere beginning to explore more radical objectives\nand methods. They criticised the Moderates for their\n“politics of prayers”, and emphasised the importance of\nself-reliance and constructive work. They argued that\npeople must rely on their own strength, not on the “good”\nintentions of the government; people must fight for\nswaraj.

Perhaps the main British motives were\nto curtail the influence of Bengali politicians\nand to split the Bengali people.\nThe partition of Bengal infuriated people\nall over India.

Large\npublic meetings and demonstrations were\norganised and novel methods of mass protest developed.\nThe struggle that unfolded came to be known as the\nSwadeshi movement, strongest in Bengal but with\nechoes elsewhere too – in deltaic Andhra for instance,\nit was known as the Vandemataram Movement.",

To fight for swaraj, the radicals advocated\nmass mobilisation and boycott of British institutions\nand goods. Some individuals also began to suggest\nthat “revolutionary violence” would be necessary to\noverthrow British rule.\nThe opening decades of the twentieth century were\nmarked by other developments as well. A group of Muslim\nlandlords and nawabs formed the All India Muslim\nLeague at Dacca in 1906. The League supported the\npartition of Bengal. It desired separate electorates for\nMuslims, a demand conceded by the government in\n1909. Some seats in the councils were now reserved\nfor Muslims who would be elected by Muslim voters.\nThis tempted politicians to gather a following by\ndistributing favours to their own religious groups.\nMeanwhile, the Congress split in 1907. The Moderates\nwere opposed to the use of boycott. They felt that it\ninvolved the use of force. After the split the Congress\ncame to be dominated by the Moderates with Tilak’s\nfollowers functioning from outside. The two groups\nreunited in December 1915. Next year the Congress\nand the Muslim League signed the historic Lucknow\nPact and decided to work together for representative\ngovernment in the country.\nThe Growth of Mass Nationalism\nAfter 1919 the struggle against British rule gradually\nbecame a mass movement, involving peasants, tribals,\nstudents and women in large numbers and occasionally\nfactory workers as well. Certain business groups too\nbegan to actively support the Congress in the 1920s.\nWhy was this so?\nThe First World War altered the economic and\npolitical situation in India. It led to a huge rise in the\ndefence expenditure of the Government of India. The\ngovernment in turn increased taxes on individual\nincomes and business profits. Increased military\nexpenditure and the demands for war supplies led to a\nsharp rise in prices which created great difficulties\nfor the common people. On the other hand, business\ngroups reaped fabulous profits from the war. As you\nhave seen (Chapter 7), the war created a demand for\nindustrial goods (jute bags, cloth, rails) and caused a\ndecline of imports from other countries into India.

Thousands of students left government-\ncontrolled schools and colleges. Many lawyers such\nas Motilal Nehru, C.R. Das, C. Rajagopalachari and\nAsaf Ali gave up their practices.

He is a Mahatma\nor\nsadhu, a Pundit, a Brahmin who lives at\nAllahabad, even a\ndeota … the real power of his\nname is to be traced back to the idea that it was he\nwho got\nbedakhli [illegal eviction] stopped in\nPratapgarh … as a general rule, Gandhi is not\nthought of as being antagonistic to Government,\nbut only to the\nzamindars … We are for Gandhiji\nand the Sarkar.\nThe happenings of 1922-1929\nMahatma Gandhi, as you know, was against violent\nmovements. He abruptly called off the Non-Cooperation\nMovement when in February 1922 a crowd of peasants\nset fire to a police station in Chauri Chaura. Twenty-\ntwo policemen were killed on that day. The peasants\nwere provoked because the police had fired on their\npeaceful demonstration.\nOnce the Non-Cooperation movement was over,\nGandhiji’s followers stressed that the Congress must\nundertake constructive work in the rural areas. Other\nleaders such as Chitta Ranjan Das and Motilal Nehru\nargued that the party should fight elections to the\ncouncils and enter them in order to influence\ngovernment policies. Through sincere social work in\nvillages in the mid-1920s, the Gandhians were able to\nextend their support base. This proved to be very useful\nin launching the Civil Disobedience movement in 1930.\nTwo important developments of the mid-1920s were\nthe formation of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh\n(RSS), a Hindu organisation, and the Communist Party of\nIndia. These parties have held very different ideas about\nthe kind of country India should be. Find out about their\nideas with the help of your teacher.

In 1930,\nGandhiji declared that he would lead a\nmarch to break the salt law. According\nto this law, the state had a monopoly\non the manufacture and sale of salt.\nMahatma Gandhi along with other\nnationalists reasoned that it was sinful\nto tax salt since it is such an essential\nitem of our food. The Salt March related\nthe general desire of freedom to a specific\ngrievance shared by everybody, and thus\ndid not divide the rich and the poor.\nGandhiji and his followers marched\nfor over 240 miles from Sabarmati to\nthe coastal town of Dandi where they\nbroke the government law by gathering\nnatural salt found on the seashore,\nand boiling sea water to produce salt.\nWomen in the freedom struggle: Ambabai from Karnataka\nWomen from diverse backgrounds participated in the national movement. Young\nand old, single and married, they came from rural and urban areas, from both\nconservative and liberal homes. Their involvement was significant for the freedom\nstruggle, for the women’s movement, and for themselves personally.\nBoth British officials and Indian nationalists felt that women’s participation gave\nthe national struggle an immense force. Participation in the freedom movement\nbrought women out of their homes. It gave them a place in the professions, in the\ngovernance of India, and it could pave the way for equality with men.\nWhat such participation meant for women is best recounted by them. Ambabai\nof Karnataka had been married at age twelve. Widowed at sixteen, she picketed\nforeign cloth and liquor shops in Udipi. She was arrested, served a sentence and\nwas rearrested. Between prison terms she made speeches, taught spinning, and\norganised prabhat pheris. Ambabai regarded these as the happiest days of her life\nbecause they gave it a new purpose and commitment.\nWomen, however, had to fight for their right to participate in the movement.\nDuring the Salt Satyagraha, for instance, even Mahatma Gandhi was initially opposed\nto women’s participation. Sarojini Naidu had to persuade him to allow women to\njoin the movement.",

It feared that\nMuslims may even go unrepresented. The Congress’s\nrejection of the League’s desire to form a joint Congress-\nLeague government in the United Provinces in 1937\nalso annoyed the League.\nThe Congress’s failure to mobilise the Muslim masses\nin the 1930s allowed the League to widen its social\nsupport. It sought to enlarge its support in the early\n1940s when most Congress leaders were in jail. At the\nend of the war in 1945, the British opened negotiations\nbetween the Congress, the League and themselves for\nthe independence of India. The talks failed because the\nLeague saw itself as the sole spokesperson of India’s\nMuslims. The Congress could not accept this claim since\na large number of Muslims still supported it.\nElections to the provinces were again held in 1946.\nThe Congress did well in the “General” constituencies\nbut the League’s success in the seats reserved for Muslims\nwas spectacular. It persisted with its demand for “Pakistan”.\nIn March 1946 the British cabinet sent a three-member\nmission to Delhi to examine this demand and to suggest\na suitable political framework for a free India.

In many of these, nationalism arose as a part of the\nanti-colonial struggles for independence.\nColonial rule in Africa was dictatorial. Only the “Chiefs” were allowed to rule on behalf\nof the foreign powers. Alternately, laws affecting Africans were created in all-white\nlegislatures. Africans had no decision-making powers or representation, not until after\nthe Second World War at least. The forcible takeover of land from local owners or users,\nincreased taxation and poor working conditions led to many African protests.\nIn 1957, Ghana, known until then as the Gold Coast, became the first sub-Saharan\nAfrican country to gain independence. The freedom movement was led by Kwame\nNkrumah’s Convention People’s Party through strikes, boycotts and mass rallies. In 1951\nthis party won a huge electoral victory. It opposed the existing system in which the\nBritish rulers had allowed the Chiefs to nominate representatives to the legislature.\nIt pressed the British to grant a legislature that contained no nominated or special\nmembers and won this demand in 1954. Elections to the new Legislative Council were\nheld in 1956. The Convention People’s Party won these, thus paving the way for the\nproclamation of an independent nation under the name “Ghana”.\n2019-200",

What would be\nyour views about the\nfuture of India?\n\nFranchise – The right to\nvote\nIndia’s population in 1947 was large, almost 345\nmillion. It was also divided. There were divisions\nbetween high castes and low castes, between the\nmajority Hindu community and Indians who practised\nother faiths. The citizens of this vast land spoke many\ndifferent languages, wore many different kinds of dress,\nate different kinds of food and practised different\nprofessions. How could they be made to live together in\none nation-state?\nTo the problem of unity was added the problem of\ndevelopment. At Independence, the vast majority of\nIndians lived in the villages. Farmers and peasants\ndepended on the monsoon for their survival. So did the\nnon-farm sector of the rural economy, for if the crops\nfailed, barbers, carpenters, weavers and other service\ngroups would not get paid for their services either. In\nthe cities, factory workers lived in crowded slums with\nlittle access to education or health care. Clearly, the\nnew nation had to lift its masses out of poverty by\nincreasing the productivity of agriculture and by\npromoting new, job-creating industries.\nUnity and development had to go hand in hand. If\nthe divisions between different sections of India were\nnot healed, they could result in violent and costly\nconflicts – high castes fighting with low castes, Hindus\nwith Muslims and so on. At the same time, if the fruits\nof economic development did not reach the broad masses\nof the population, it could create fresh divisions – for\nexample, between the rich and the poor, between cities\nand the countryside, between regions of India that were\nprosperous and regions that lagged behind.\nA Constitution is Written\nBetween December 1946 and November 1949, some\nthree hundred Indians had a series of meetings on\nthe country’s political future. The meetings of this\n“Constituent Assembly” were held in New Delhi, but\nthe participants came from all over India, and from\ndifferent political parties. These discussions resulted\nin the framing of the Indian Constitution, which came\ninto effect on 26 January 1950.\nOne feature of the Constitution was its adoption of\nuniversal adult franchise. All Indians above the age of\n21 would be allowed to vote in state and national\nelections.

The practice of untouchability, described\nas a “slur and a blot” on the “fair name of India”,\nwas abolished. Hindu temples, previously open to\nonly the higher castes, were thrown open to\nall, including the former untouchables. After a\nlong debate, the Constituent Assembly also\nrecommended that a certain percentage of seats\nin legislatures as well as jobs in government be\nreserved for members of the lowest castes.

But, as one member\nof the Constituent Assembly, H.J.

Many\nmembers believed that the English language should\nleave India with the British rulers. Its place, they\nargued, should be taken by Hindi. However, those who\ndid not speak Hindi were of a different opinion. Speaking\nin the Assembly, T.T.

A compromise was finally arrived at: namely,\nthat while Hindi would be the “official language” of India,\nEnglish would be used in the courts, the services, and\ncommunications between one state and another.\nMany Indians contributed to the framing of the\nConstitution. But perhaps the most important role was\nplayed by Dr B.R. Ambedkar, who was Chairman of\nthe Drafting Committee, and under whose supervision\nthe document was finalised. In his final speech to the\nConstituent Assembly, Dr Ambedkar pointed out that\npolitical democracy had to be accompanied by economic\nand social democracy.

As a result of the partition of India, more\nthan a million people had been killed in riots between\nHindus and Muslims. Could the country afford further\ndivisions on the basis of language?\nBoth Prime Minister Nehru and Deputy Prime\nMinister Vallabhbhai Patel were against the creation\nof linguistic states. After the Partition, Nehru said,\n“disruptionist tendencies had come to the fore”; to check\nthem, the nation had to be strong and united.

The Kannada\nspeakers, Malayalam speakers, the Marathi speakers, had\nall looked forward to having their own state. The strongest\nprotests, however, came from the Telugu-speaking districts\nof what was the Madras Presidency. When Nehru went\nto campaign there during the general elections of 1952,\nhe was met with black flags and slogans demanding\n“We want Andhra”. In October of that year, a veteran\nGandhian named Potti Sriramulu went on a hunger\nstrike demanding the formation of Andhra state to\nprotect the interests of Telugu speakers. As the fast\nwent on, it attracted much support. Hartals and bandhs\nwere observed in many towns.\n2019-200",

He explained the ideals and purposes\nof planning in a series of letters he wrote to the chief\nministers of the different states. In a letter of 22 December\n1952, he said that:\n... behind the First Five Year Plan lies the conception of\nIndia’s unity and of a mighty co-operative effort of all\nthe peoples of India … We have to remember always\nthat it is not merely the governmental machinery that\ncounts in all this, but even more so the enthusiasm and\nco-operation of the people. Our people must have the\nsensation of partnership in a mighty enterprise, of being\nfellow-travellers towards the next goal that they and\nwe have set before us. The Plan may be, and has to be,\nbased on the calculations of economists, statisticians and\nthe like, but figures and statistics, very important as\nthey are, do not give life to the scheme. That breath of\nlife comes in other ways, and it is for us now to make\nthis Plan, which is enshrined in cold print, something\nliving, vital and dynamic, which captures the\nimagination of the people.",

At that\ntime a new international body\n– the United Nations – formed\nin 1945 was in its infancy.\nThe 1950s and 1960s saw the\nemergence of the Cold War,\nthat is, power rivalries and\nideological conflicts between\nthe USA and the USSR, with\nboth countries creating military alliances. This was also the period\nwhen colonial empires were collapsing and many countries were\nattaining independence. Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, who was\nalso the foreign minister of newly independent India, developed\nfree India’s foreign policy in this context. Non-alignment formed\nthe bedrock of this foreign policy.\nLed by statesmen from Egypt, Yugoslavia, Indonesia, Ghana\nand India, the non-aligned movement urged countries not to\njoin either of the two major alliances. But this policy of staying\naway from alliances was not a matter of remaining “isolated” or\n“neutral”. The former means remaining aloof from world affairs\nwhereas non-aligned countries such as India played an active\nrole in mediating between the American and Soviet alliances.\nThey tried to prevent war — often taking a humanitarian and\nmoral stand against war. However, for one reason or another,\nmany non-aligned countries including India got involved in wars.\nBy the 1970s, a large number of countries had joined the\nnon-aligned movement.",

And to what extent has it fulfilled\nthe ideals set out in its Constitution?\nThat India is still united, and that it is still democratic,\nare achievements that we might justly be proud of. Many\nforeign observers had felt that India could not survive\nas a single country, that it would break up into many\nparts, with each region or linguistic group seeking to\nform a nation of its own. Others believed that it would\ncome under military rule. However, as many as thirteen\ngeneral elections have been held since Independence,\nas well as hundreds of state and local elections. There\nis a free press, as well as an independent judiciary.\nFinally, the fact that people speak different languages\nor practise different faiths has not come in the way of\nnational unity.\nOn the other hand, deep divisions\npersist. Despite constitutional\nguarantees, the Untouchables or, as\nthey are now referred to, the Dalits,\nface violence and discrimination.\nIn many parts of rural India they\nare not allowed access to water\nsources, temples, parks and other\npublic places. And despite the secular\nideals enshrined in the Constitution,\nthere have been clashes between\ndifferent religious groups in many\nstates. Above all, as many observers\nhave noted, the gulf between the\nrich and the poor has grown over the years. Some parts\nof India and some groups of Indians have benefited a\ngreat deal from economic development. They live in large\nhouses and dine in expensive restaurants, send their\nchildren to expensive private schools and take expensive\nforeign holidays. At the same time many others continue\nto live below the poverty line. Housed in urban slums,\nor living in remote villages on lands that yield little,\nthey cannot afford to send their children to school.\nThe Constitution recognises equality before the law,\nbut in real life some Indians are more equal than others.\nJudged by the standards it set itself at Independence,\nthe Republic of India has not been a great success.\nBut it has not been a failure either.\nINDIA AFTER INDEPENDENCE",

This made Sinhala the medium of instruction in all state\nschools and colleges, in public examinations, and in the courts. The new Act was opposed\nby the Tamil-speaking minority who lived in the north of the island. “When you deny me\nmy language,” said one Tamil MP, “you deny me everything.” “You are hoping for a divided\nCeylon,” warned another, adding: “Do not fear, I assure you [that you] will have a divided\nCeylon.” An Opposition member, himself Sinhala speaking, predicted that if the\ngovernment did not change its mind and insisted on the Act being passed, “two torn little\nbleeding states might yet arise out of one little state”.\nFor several decades now, a civil war has raged in\nSri Lanka, whose roots lie in the imposition of the\nSinhala language on the Tamil-speaking minority.\nAnd another South Asian country, Pakistan, was\ndivided into two when the Bengali speakers of the\neast felt that their language was being suppressed.\nBy contrast, India has managed to survive as a single\nnation, in part because the many regional languages\nwere given freedom to flourish. Had Hindi been\nimposed on South India, in the way that Urdu was\nimposed on East Pakistan or Sinhala on northern\nSri Lanka, India too might have seen civil war and\nfragmentation. Contrary to the fears of Jawahalal\nNehru and Sardar Patel, linguistic states have not threatened the unity of India. Rather,\nthey have deepened this unity. Once the fear of one’s language being suppressed has\ngone, the different linguistic groups have been content to live as part of the larger nation\ncalled India.",
